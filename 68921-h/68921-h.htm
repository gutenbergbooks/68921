<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story within these covers has been written
from impressions received in boyhood days, ideas
which time could not erase and which the passing
of the years has developed and strengthened. It is
perhaps only fair to state frankly that the story is
largely founded on fact, though, for purposes which
will be obvious, the characters have been treated
from a general rather than a particular sense.</p>

<p>The aim has been to follow a young man’s life
from his home in the Orkney Islands, one hundred
years ago, through his experiences in what was then
an untravelled country in the Canadian West, and
to show how, in his humble, commonplace way, he
took hold of the opportunities which presented themselves,
small though they might seem to us to be, and
built up a character and a place for himself in the
community which stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Hundreds of our Canadian pioneers did just this
in the simple, honest, straightforward lives they led
in the early days of this country, and it is on the
foundations they laid in those days that Canada’s
greatness now has been reared.</p>

<p>All honor to the stalwart Canadian pioneer. Both
the young and the old of to-day may well renew in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
memory the struggles and sacrifices by which Canada’s
foundation was well and truly laid. It is one of
the greatest legacies which the past has bequeathed
to us. It is one of the treasures that we should
fondly cling to.</p>

<p>May we never forget the heroic daring, the finer
qualities of self-denial, of loyalty to duty, stronger
than the love of life, of the temper which dreads
dishonor more than it fears death and the patriotism
which makes love of home and country a passion.</p>

<p>Never were the fortunes of a vast heritage, such
as Canada possessed, entrusted to stouter hearts than
those of the pioneers. They were the resolute, grim,
silent heroes of the majestic Canadian forest solitudes.
They were intense in doing good and were
possessed of great, chivalrous souls.</p>

<p>Those rugged sons and daughters of the Motherland
crossed the sea and marched into the Canadian
forest solitude without beat of drum. They built
their log cabins amidst the towering forest giants,
the giants which reached heavenward.</p>

<p>The fire of love for right and liberty which shone
so brightly in the pioneers’ everyday life still burns
fiercely in the hearts of Canada’s sons. The heroic
deeds of valor, of service and sacrifice on the battlefields
of Flanders by our boys have thrilled the heart
of the world and welded forever an unbroken chain
between that of the early pioneer fathers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
mothers, and that of their sons and daughters of
to-day, for the cause of liberty, freedom and righteousness,
for the love of home and country, for the
love of the Motherland, for the love of peace and
goodwill to men.</p>

<p>If the story herein told marks the path of duty
more plainly for others; if it assists the youth in
steering his life ship clear of the danger shoals discovered
on my life’s voyage; if it inspires a more
sturdy character, or if it influences one young man
or young woman helpfully, I shall be well repaid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<i>LEAVING HOME.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Close</span> to the bleak coast of the Orkney Islands,
not far from where Lord Kitchener found his final
resting-place and where the waves seemed to dash
ceaselessly upon the rocky coast with an echo of the
wonderful leader’s message, “Your King and Country
need you,” there resided, in a cottage home, a
family of seven, father and mother, four brothers
and a sister. Luxuries were things unknown in the
home, since the securing of a mere living was in
itself a considerable problem, and so, while the children
had been reared in habits of industry and
thriftiness, they early appreciated that under these
circumstances the future did not present an especially
rosy aspect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="14a"><img src="images/i_014f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ROBERT AND WILL HEARING THE STORY OF<br /> OPPORTUNITY IN A NEW LAND.</p>

<p>The situation appealed particularly to the eldest
sons, Robert and William, who were sixteen and
eighteen years of age, stalwart youths who, if no
other gifts had been given them, were endowed with
splendid constitutions, capable of great endurance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
There was little or no work to be had at their
island home and consequently little opportunity for
advancement. Their father realized that the sons
should be given an opportunity to hew out a destiny
greater than their immediate condition would permit,
but the mother, like all good mothers, found it
exceedingly hard to countenance the thought of her
boys leaving home. Even so early as this, a hundred
years ago, stories of the wonderful opportunities of
the new colony across the seas, Canada, had found
their way to the little Islands, and it was perhaps
only natural that the thoughts of the youths should
turn toward this country of untried hopes. Since
money was not plentiful in the home there was no
means at hand to provide for the securing of a passage,
but ultimately the opportunity was presented
in an unexpected way. As we now know so well,
early Canadian development, particularly in the
West, was largely in the hands of the Hudson’s Bay
Company, which had been, even for some years
previous to this, carrying on a large fur trade under
special Government permission. Since young men
were exceedingly scarce in Canada, when the Company
desired new employees they naturally turned to
the Old Land. In this case an experienced employee
on such a search, knowing something of the characteristics
of the Orkney men, visited the Islands, and
his requirements became known to the two brothers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Only specially fitted young men of fine physique and
those who had been trained in their homes to a
knowledge of discipline and duty, which, of course,
meant a knowledge of what hard work implied, were
considered. The applicants must necessarily possess
reputation without reproach, and a character which
stood out upon their faces. What the Company
wanted were young men of the highest type, who
could be absolutely depended on to do their whole
duty amid the most trying circumstances. The necessity
for this can be understood when it is known that
the work of these employees demanded dealing with
the Indians as well as with the white men, and possibly
the protection of the rights of the Company
against a whole Indian tribe. Robert and William,
although they were somewhat younger than the men
usually chosen, measured so fully up to the required
standard that they made a splendid impression on
the Company’s employee, and were consequently
placed under contract.</p>

<p>Aside from the novelty and excitement of experiences
to be expected in a new land, the immediate
financial terms of the position were not great. An
iron-clad contract providing for payment of ten
pounds per year for the first four years was signed
by the lads. This, it will be noted, was the equivalent
of about fifty dollars each per year, which was
surely a low salary for picked young men. When it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was considered that the duties to be expected of the
men were not only arduous but dangerous, and
would require isolation from civilization for a considerable
period, the wages offered could not be said
to be large. However, the outlook for a future in a
country which was known in those days as a mighty
wilderness, with rivers and lakes so large that the
early explorers had been able to trace only a slight
portion, and famed for its game and fur-bearing
animals, possessed a wonderful attraction. Again,
since money had been so little known at home the
sum seemed very large to them, much larger than
it would have done to lads under different circumstances.
Some idea of their characters may be
gleaned from the fact that they requested a special
clause in the contract providing for one half of their
earnings to be paid direct to their parents, and with
the contract once signed it was realized by all who
knew them that it would be thoroughly lived up to.
They were prepared to give their best in the hope of
making a favorable impression upon the Company’s
Chief Factor, who had charge of the concern’s business
in Canada. To them the word of encouragement
meant considerably more than did their wages.</p>

<p>Farewells in those days were just as painful as
they are now. Naturally, as the time for departure
drew near, the bustle of preparation was the main
factor in evidence in that Orkney Island home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Mother and sister worked early and late knitting
socks, making warm underclothing and a supply of
woolen shirts, together with every necessary outfit.
Nowadays, lads in similar circumstances would have
used trunks for their equipment, but such things
were not known at all familiarly and, besides, could
not have been afforded. The equipment was packed
in two boxes which had been made by the two lads
themselves and which, for strength and workmanship,
were of a kind not seen to-day. Nails, too,
were not known in that day, and their place was
taken by wooden pegs. Nowadays, too, articles of
other than home manufacture would have found a
large place in the boxes. How this was obviated
then is explained in a special case. The father of
the home had been accustomed to making the footwear
for the family. He made special inquiry from
the Company’s agent as to what would be best for
his sons in their long and trying journeys in the wilderness,
and after a good deal of labor intermingled
with love, provided a supply to last a considerable
time. One gift, however, was purchased. Out of
the very small store of money which was kept for
emergencies the mother took a little and, unknown
to the others, sent the sister, Jeanette, to the little
village to purchase two small Bibles. In them, written
with her own hand and accompanied by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
earnest prayer commending them to God’s tender
love and care, were their names.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="19a"><img src="images/i_019f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THE HOME-FOLK.</p>

<p>Finally the day arrived for the departure. As
could be anticipated, the family all went to the dock
for the last farewell, and even the faithful collie
which Robert had raised from a pup was there and
appeared to understand in his own way that his
master and chum was leaving, probably never to
return. Robert patted the dog, who wagged his tail
and looked up at his master with affection in his
eyes. Outside the family, many of their school
chums, both boys and girls, were present, and the
tears in their eyes readily indicated their feelings.
The young people had been, as it were, one big
family, and the hearts of the others were touched
when they realized that two of their chums were
leaving them. This again gave evidence of the
standing of the young men in the community. Their
sterling deeds and kindly words had made a host of
friends for them. They had no enemies and, of course,
the preacher, the school teacher, and other people of
standing in the community were present to sympathize
and to be near the two young men who were
so loved and respected. As the moments passed
before the vessel’s cables were drawn in all had said
their farewell but the mother. She sobbed bitterly
and clung to her sons, and apparently could not console<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
herself for allowing them to leave the fireside
of their home. The boys in turn caressed their
mother, moistening her cheeks with their tears, and
spoke many cheery words, assuring her they would
write to her often and would do their best to return
some day when the bright future they anticipated
had been realized. The mother’s last words were:
“Remember your Bibles, boys. I wish you would
read them often and get to know the good things in
them well. Don’t forget that God will be with you
just as well across the sea as He would here. It
doesn’t matter where you are, in the wilderness or
by the lakes, He will stay with you night and day
just the same, and if you love and serve Him truly
there will not be any doubt about the future for all
of us.” After a moment, when she was again able
to control herself, she went on: “If it should happen
that I do not see you again at our home here, my
lads, I will be waiting for you in a better place up
yonder.”</p>

<p>The happenings on the dock had had an interested
watcher. The captain of the vessel, a bluff old tar
who had witnessed many similar partings, was naturally
interested in the crowd which had gathered
on the dock to say farewell to the two stalwart
youths. As the mother clung to the boys past the
moment of departure, he hadn’t the heart at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to give the order to cast loose, and when finally the
order came it was not in the gruff voice which usually
prevailed, and as the vessel slowly drew away
from the dock he doffed his cap to the mother and,
in a voice still showing his feeling, called out:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mother. Your boys will be safe
on my ship.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<i>THE VOYAGE.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Trans-Atlantic</span> voyages in those days were not
made with the same comfort nor by any means in
the same time that are occupied now. The young
men who have been coming to Canada in recent
years board a ship in Liverpool on Friday and land
at Montreal on Friday or Saturday. Nothing of
the kind, however, was expected by the travellers on
the Hudson’s Bay Company’s vessel. Even now we
know how uncertain and even hazardous a voyage
into the great northern inland sea—for in those days
the most direct passage to the Company’s Western
posts was by way of Hudson Bay—can be at certain
seasons of the year. In those days, when the trip
was made on a small sailing vessel, they started out
with the anticipation of a voyage which might
occupy six months, or even a year, and with this
was the chance that the ship might be caught in the
endless fields of ice which occupied the straits for
so long a season and never reach its destination.
The vessel was one of the Company’s regular ships,
which was scheduled to make one trip each year and
carry the annual mail, which arrived at the Western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
headquarters of the Company during the year. Her
cargo was comprised of supplies for the various
camps and trading-posts, and these materials were
distributed from Fort Churchill and Port Nelson, on
the Hudson Bay coast, to the inland stations which
had been established from these bases. Ammunition,
guns, traps, various kinds of food, heavy blankets
and clothing constituted the greater part of the
cargo, but along with these was carried a substantial
supply of the trinkets which greatly pleased the
Indians in those days and which were used for trading
purposes. On their return journey the ships
were loaded with furs which had been caught in the
interior during the winter and forwarded to the
Company’s stations, from which they had been in
turn packed to the Hudson Bay ports.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular crew the ship’s company
comprised a score or more picked young men from
the Orkneys and other sections of northern Scotland.
Favors were not very much known among
these men of the sea, and usually the Company’s
young men were left pretty much to themselves.
The captain’s attention, however, had been specially
drawn by the mother’s affectionate farewell to Robert
and Will and, as might be expected, his heart
had been warmed toward the youths. By reason of
this, though it was not understood by the young
men, they were given a favored spot for their sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
quarters and were placed rather nearer amidships
than usual. To anyone who crossed in the
early days on one of these small sailing vessels it
will be at once apparent how much comfort this, as
compared with other locations, would mean to the
two lads.</p>

<p>Do you remember how you felt the first night you
were away from home when darkness set in? If
so you will realize something of what the two lads
of our story felt that night, and their feelings were
intensified by the realization that they were on the
mighty deep, this thought being impressed by the
lapping of the water on the ship’s bows and the
realization that the farewell of the afternoon was to
be possibly the last one. It is under such conditions
that temptation to forget one’s home principles easily
finds a place, and the first test was to come at this
time to Robert and William. As can be appreciated,
the crew of the vessel were largely old salts, who
had known only a hard-and-fast life, with all the
temptations which come to seafaring men. Since
the sleeping quarters of the young men adjoined those
of the crew, the type of language which came to the
ears of the Company’s young employees when the
crew were preparing for sleep can be imagined. For
a time the two listened and contained themselves as
best they could, and finally Robert spoke. “This is
not what we have been taught at home,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
“We will kneel together and say our prayers.” And
in the midst of this company of rough, inconsiderate
men, they offered up a prayer, simple, uncultured,
and yet one which meant so much, to the God they
had learned to love and trust. The other youths who
accompanied them were silent. Most of them had
been reared in good homes, but they did not exhibit
the courage of Robert and William. While the heroic
stand of the two lads—and just how heroic the act
was will not be appreciated immediately by many of
my readers—did not seem to have much effect on
the crew, and some of them had kept on with their
oaths and curses, reflecting on the lads themselves,
one member, and a leader among the others, had
been strongly impressed. As he noted the manly
way in which the two lads knelt, adhering to their
principles, in the middle of the rough, uncouth crew,
in spite of himself his mind turned back to his
youthful days, to the old home fireside where he had
knelt with mother, father, sisters and brothers; and
when he saw the two lads open the Bibles their
mother had given them that afternoon he was
reminded of the Bible his mother had presented to
him forty or fifty years ago. He heard, also, his
mother’s last words running in his ears and, as can
be imagined, it was some time before he went to
sleep. Sandy did not sleep well that night, either.
Memories of home and of earlier days and better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
things persisted, and when he woke a kindlier feeling
than usual possessed his heart. He appreciated
more than he had done before what it had meant
to the two lads to take the stand they had done then,
and perhaps because of this, when the ship’s company
was called to breakfast, Robert was placed at
the head of the table. He was the youngest of the
company and could scarcely see why he was given
this honor. As could be expected, many of the men
fell to immediately, but Robert, again remembering
his home principles and feeling that his position gave
him some authority, rose and lifting his hand in a
commanding way, said: “Men, if you will bow your
heads I will ask a blessing.” It might seem that this
action would have been likely to stir up trouble, but
perhaps by reason of Robert’s steady eye, his earnestness,
and his commanding appearance, as well as by
his manly act the night before, his wish was obeyed.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, ocean travellers expect to rest and
enjoy themselves. The Hudson’s Bay Company,
however, provided no such easy means of entertainment
for their apprentices, and a distinct programme
of instruction and work to be done on the ship had
been laid out for them. To provide for this, along
with the captain and the other ship’s officers, a man
who had seen many years in the Company’s service
was included, whose duties were to take charge of
the young men on their voyage and make them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
familiar with the services they would be called on
to render in the new field. Thus on the first morning,
immediately after breakfast, this instructional
work was begun. At first the small things were
taken up, and each of the young men was put at a
different task. The making of harness for dogs, for
instance, was given to one, the repairing of snowshoes
to another, the filling of cartridges, cleaning of
guns, the handling of traps was taken up by other
young men. Some of them were given instruction
in the difficult art of doing up a pack and how to
carry that pack properly. Others were given hints
as to proper cooking in the wilds. Then others were
instructed as to how to meet emergencies and as to
how energy, resourcefulness and courage could be
utilized under the varying conditions of the new service.
It was necessary also that each one should have
at least some understanding of the Indian dialect.
Sketches were shown of the different Indian tribes,
bringing out their characteristics so that these should
be familiar when they were met with in the forest
solitudes. Interesting as this work was, it required
not only close but incessant application. However,
the young men had been well selected. They were
the type of youths who said, “We can, We will!”
They were told plainly and bluntly that no weakling
could live in the forest solitude, and that it was their
duty to be prepared for emergencies of all kinds. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the voyage progressed they were given further
instruction in woodcraft and trapping of animals,
and how to meet and dispose of the larger animals,
such as the grizzly, the silver tip, the mountain lion,
the wolf, and others which they would meet in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>With the practical side of this instruction came a
romance side. At times the Company’s officer very
kindly accompanied his instruction with stories of
his experiences in the regions unknown to the young
men. While he was strict with them, he was patient,
and naturally the most of them grew very fond of
him. They saw through his stories that in the new
life there was to be conflict among ever-changing
conditions and that with this adventure came victory—victory
not only in things which pertained to the
Company’s welfare, but also which extended to the
making of their own characters. The lads longed to
try their fortune where nature was supreme, where
the feet of white men had seldom if ever trod, where
the conflict of nature was unceasing.</p>

<p>At first, outside of the learning of these new
duties, the voyage passed uneventfully. Half of the
anticipated time of passage had gone by. The winds
had largely been favorable. It is true that rough
seas had been encountered, but these had been
expected, and bore with them the usual quota of
trial in seasickness, which after a time lost its effect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
All on board were well, and as the announcement
was made that more than half the distance had been
covered and that Hudson Bay might be reached in
two or three months, an atmosphere of cheerfulness
was everywhere evident.</p>

<p>But with the passage of time had come somewhat
changed conditions, particularly among members of
the crew. After a little time Sandy was influenced
to hunt up his Bible, deep among the worn-out clothing
in his seaman’s chest, and when he brought it
forth to the light it was seen that the blue ribbon
which had been tied around the precious book by his
own mother, forty-five years before, still retained its
place. The Bible had not been opened. The mother’s
message inside had not been read. Tenderly and
with tears in his eyes in spite of the hardness which
had come with his years of rough living, Sandy
loosened the knot and opened the book. Inside he
found a one-pound note, with the message, “Sandy,
my boy, take this. It is all I have. As you go
through life do not forget that you should always
do God’s will and help others. If you can only help
boys to be men, Sandy, I will be proud of you.” The
note was signed “Your affectionate, loving mother.”</p>

<p>The influence of the two lads had been made
apparent in other ways. Sandy now said his prayers
at nights, and a few of the crew followed his
example. Some of the men held aloof, but there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
no more carousing at bedtime. Men who had not
learned to bow the knee to their heavenly Father in
each others’ presence at least had learned to respect
those who did.</p>

<p>No member of the crew dared to speak badly of
Robert and Will in Sandy’s presence. They knew
it would mean a fight to a finish. The two lads had
no truer friend on board than Sandy. The members
of the crew well understood this, and for this reason,
if not for their own sake, were always respectful to
the two young men; and in addition to this they
admired them for their pluck and courage. They
realized that almost any lad could fall in and drift
with the crowd, but that it required backbone and
unusual courage to stand alone for what was right
when they were surrounded by men such as made
up the ship’s crew.</p>

<p>For many years Sandy had been associated with
men of a lower type, and he consequently understood
that they as well as himself respected the
young man who, possessing backbone and nerve,
fought at all times for the principles he believed to
be right. These men were rough and uncouth and
had forgotten a good deal of their early training,
but at heart they still had considerable of inherent
goodness. In consequence, they learned to love
Robert and Will because the lads played the game
of life fairly and squarely and under well-defined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and well-recognized rules. The young men carried
the matter of right straight into the enemy’s camp
and had won the first round of the game, as we have
seen, the first night they were on board the ship. As
a baseball writer would put it, “Robert had put the
first ball straight over home plate and had registered
a strike.” Following this he kept on with his good
pitching. Sandy, in his turn, played the game also
like a man and tried to instil the same spirit into his
friends of the crew.</p>

<p>As days passed it was noticed that the air became
more chill. The thermometer showed a much lower
temperature. To the seamen this was indicative of
a peril which did not evidence itself to the young
men who were making their first voyage. What this
was will perhaps be guessed when it is known that
the lookouts were doubled and that the captain and
mate spent considerably more of their time on the
bridge. Then one day, just as the sun was setting,
the lookout sang out:</p>

<p>“Berg two points to sta’board, sir.”</p>

<p>And in a few minutes the golden glow of the sinking
ball of fire could be seen reflected on the peak of
a huge iceberg a little to the right. As can be imagined,
the young men revelled in this unusual sight,
and when the vessel passed within a mile of the berg
it gave the appearance of a frozen mountain of
diamonds. After some inquiries Robert and Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
learned the reason for the care on the part of the
ship’s officers. It appeared to them that the danger
was over so soon as the berg was passed, but when
they were told that the danger was not so great from
the visible ice mountains as from those which lay
closer to the sea and which were not so much in
evidence, they understood the situation better.</p>

<p>Other dangers added their quota to the excitement.
Heretofore exceedingly good weather had
been enjoyed on the voyage, but now it seemed that
the gods of the storm had settled their efforts on the
destruction of the little craft. For several days a
hurricane of wind, snow and sleet prevailed. Sails
were blown to bits. Ice fields were numerous, thus
causing a great deal of anxiety to the officers and
crew. Attempts were made to escape the larger
bergs, but, time after time, in spite of all efforts, it
did appear that some of these numerous ice mountains
would carry the ship downwards into the deep.
When lulls in the gale appeared the ship was hove to
and new sails were bent on to take the place of those
destroyed. Every man on board was doing his full
duty and with a determination to keep the good ship
afloat.</p>

<p>On the eighth day of the storm, when its fury
seemed to be increasing a shout was suddenly heard,
even above the roar of the sea: “Man overboard!”
came from half a dozen throats. Looking quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
over the side, Robert noted a man in the grip of the
cold, angry sea, and a moment later identified him
as his friend Sandy, whom a huge wave had carried
some distance from the vessel. Robert’s early training
and native courage at once came to the fore.
Waiting only to throw off his coat and boots, he
leaped from the deck into the foaming sea and started
with strong strokes for the drowning man. Fortunate
it was that Robert had practised the art of swimming
from boyhood and that over and over he had
swam through the mountainous waves which at
times surrounded his island home. Many and many
a time, for the pure love of it, he and his brothers
had made their way through the howling surf of the
rocky coast and had gloried in thus defeating the
strength of nature. All this stood him in good stead
now. While Sandy was able to keep afloat, he was
a much older man, and in the maelstrom which surrounded
him it was impossible for him to make headway.
All on board watched the struggle of the
young hero. Some suggested that a boat should be
launched, but the captain knew that this was impossible.
A boat would not have lived a minute in such
a sea. The captain followed the best plan he knew,
however, and ordered the lowering of the main sails,
so that the ship’s way was checked until only steerage-way
remained. As the vessel tossed it was difficult
to follow the two imperilled men. Now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
then their heads could be seen above the storm-lashed
sea. It was evident that Robert was making
headway and that Sandy had seen Robert and was
doing his best to reach his rescuer, though he disappeared
and rose again at intervals. Then a huge
wave picked him up and carried him speedily toward
the goal he was striving for.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="32a"><img src="images/i_032f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“HE LEAPED FROM THE DECK INTO THE FOAMING SEA.”</p>

<p>As Sandy struggled his mind was not idle. A
thousand and one thoughts ran through his mind.
He wanted to live at that moment more than he had
ever done before. He wanted to visit once more the
home of his boyhood days, to take back the little
Bible to his dear old mother, to kneel at her side and
thank her for the Book that had helped to win him
back to his God. He wanted, too, to thank the young
man who had brought him back to a realization of his
position and who, he knew now, was braving unusual
peril for his sake. Sandy wanted to do something
worth while in whatever remained to him of life.
He prayed during these moments of agony, during
this time of suspense between life and death. His
heart cried out to God and, as is always the case, he
was heard. As his power and strength seemed to be
waning, and when he was about ready to give up, a
strong arm grasped him in a vicelike grip. Robert
had caught him under the arms and was swimming
with his heavy burden toward the ship. When it was
seen that the rescuer’s goal had been reached a cheer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
went up heartily from those on board. This, in turn,
was drowned by the roaring and hissing of the
waves. Robert was now making a supreme effort.
Again and again he disappeared with his burden,
and again and again mighty waves seemed to be
trying to wrench his charge from his grasp. He
realized that the life of his friend depended on him,
and set himself to additional effort.</p>

<p>In the meantime Will had been watching the scene
with a readiness second only to his brother. He,
like Robert, had played and fought with the waves
that dashed on the Orkney shores, and he, too, had
gained from these struggles a courage which was
only waiting to be tried. In the moments of waiting
until it seemed his efforts would be necessary he also
had removed his outer clothing and stood among the
old tars of the crew ready to give himself when the
time came. As was only natural, swimmers there
were in numbers among these rough men, but not
another was ready to tackle the job that the lads
were ready to meet. Will watched his brother as
closely as the drenching seas permitted, and when it
seemed that his strength was failing he, without hesitation,
plunged headlong into the sea and struck out
with lengthy strokes which were the admiration of
the crew. He knew Robert’s powers better than any
of the others, but he realized that even a giant’s
endurance could not last in such conditions, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
planned to relieve his brother of the burden which
he knew must be so overwhelming to him. After a
few moments he reached the side of the two struggling
men and with some difficulty persuaded Robert
to relinquish his hold on Sandy and finally, after
continued struggling through the waves, which
seemed reluctant to give up their prey, they reached
the ship and were helped aboard.</p>

<p>At first it appeared surprising that while the two
lads seemed to regain their usual strength immediately
and were able to walk to their sleeping quarters,
Sandy was almost altogether overcome, and it was
necessary that efforts to revive him should be made.
To those who thought about it, however, it showed
that the victory won by the two lads proved at once
that they had led clean lives and were possessed of
the kind of courage which through all the history of
the world has overcome the greatest obstacles. The
first act of the brothers when they returned to the
sleeping quarters was to get down on their knees and
thank their Heavenly Father for the strength He
had given them to save the life of a friend.</p>

<p>After another day the storm seemed to wreak its
fury. The sun shone once more and prospects
seemed much more favorable. How the lads were
greeted after their heroic experience can well be
appreciated. They had made a warm place in the
hearts of the crew before, but now they had proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
themselves heroes, and while not much of the feeling
was expressed in words, they felt the goodwill
of both captain and crew in a good many ways. In
a few days, too, Sandy was about again quite as well
as ever. Words would fail to tell his appreciation of
what his friends had done for him.</p>

<p>Two weeks more of changeable weather was
experienced, with wind enough to keep the ship
well on her course, and then, all in a moment as it
seemed, on one bright day endless fields of ice
loomed up ahead. The captain, with glass in hand,
stood on the bridge looking for an opening to the
east, and after sailing along the apparently impenetrable
barrier for several hours a narrow sheet of
open water was finally encountered. The ship’s
course was set for the open space, but when the spot
which had formerly been clear was reached disappointment
was manifest, for there was no open
channel in evidence, but only grinding, crushing,
pushing ice. They had come to the edge of the
northern ice fields which, opening and closing at
intervals, made it perilous for any ship built as they
were at that time to attempt a passage. Nowadays
a Canadian Government ice-crusher would have
forced a way without difficulty over the ice-pack.
Then, with a vessel built for ocean travelling and
with little experience in ice, this was not possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
The captain, though, had had years of experience in
Hudson Bay conditions and had sailed in the northern
waters in the sealing and whaling trade years
before. He knew that the ship must be kept clear
of the dangerous field or it would be in constant
peril of being crushed or pinched by the mass of ice
which, pushed by the millions of tons of ice and the
forces of wind and wave and tide behind, moved
together with titanic force. So he was contented to
follow a course in the open sea for a week in order
to avoid these difficulties.</p>

<p>Following a southern course, at the end of several
days the end of the ice field was reached and blue
water was in evidence ahead. Suddenly a sight of
much interest appeared to the young men when a
whale was seen blowing off the port bow. The next
morning, which was Sunday, brought joy to the
hearts of all and an appreciation that the end of
the voyage was approaching, with the lookout’s
announcement that land was sighted. Some surprise
was caused again when Sandy suggested a
special service of thanksgiving. For weeks he had
been doing his best to bring his friends of the crew
to a realization of the responsibilities of life. In the
sleeping quarters, when the men were off duty, he
had talked to them as never before, and many who
had sailed with him for years were impressed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the fervor of his prayers and could not help but be
convinced of the staunch stand he had taken to serve
his Maker as best he knew.</p>

<p>There was reason for rejoicing. The sight of land
confirmed the result of the captain’s observations,
and when it was known that after a week or ten
days of clear sailing they would reach the end of the
voyage, feelings of thankfulness and cheer were
much in evidence. Smaller icebergs and less extensive
ice fields were now encountered, and here the
youthful employees of the Hudson’s Bay Company
saw for the first time polar bears with their cubs,
walrus, seal, and other animals of the kind which
made their home in Hudson Bay waters.</p>

<p>Anyone who has occasion to cross the Atlantic
now knows, or finds out before the passage is
complete, that it is the custom to organize a ship’s
concert. Even at this early date the custom had been
established, and now that the end of the passage
appeared to be in sight such entertainment was
arranged for. In this everyone took part.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="38a"><img src="images/i_038f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW POLAR BEARS.”</p>

<p>The arrival of the vessel meant a good deal to
other than those on board, a fact which was not
thoroughly appreciated during the passage by the
young men who were travelling to the new land for
the first time. On the voyage of this one vessel the
Company’s employees in the far Canadian West
depended almost wholly for their supplies and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
a great deal of their food. With the centre of the
Company’s interests at Fort Churchill, the officers
and employees of the concern naturally gathered at
that point, and recently food there had been running
somewhat low. As can be expected also, there were
many who were looking forward with great expectations
to letters from their loved ones at home. The
Factor and those in charge knew, if the vessel had
had an ordinary voyage, what time she might
be expected, and as the anticipated date approached
a sharp lookout was kept each day for signs of the
white sails. Several days passed unavailingly, but
finally patience was rewarded and a cheer went up
from the employees of the Company gathered at the
Fort as the ship came in sight. For the last few
days, also, the inhabitants of the Fort had been
added to by numbers of Indians who from year to
year came to see the Company’s vessel arrive. It
was the great event of the year for the people of that
land. Many of the Indians had trapped faithfully
for the Company during the winter; the result of
their work had been placed to their credit in the
Company’s books, and in return for this they were
anxious to secure useful articles which were comprised
in the ship’s cargo. When the vessel drew
into the dock there was a shout of rejoicing and, as
can be imagined, it was a varied crowd of humanity
which pressed toward her. The Indians, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
as they had been taught from year to year, kept a
respectful distance, and the Factor was the first man
to grasp the hand of the captain when the men
reached shore. After the captain and officers,
the first to land were the score or more youths who
had been so carefully selected to further the Company’s
trade. One of the features most looked for
in the vessel’s arrival was the mail which she brought.
In these days, when letters and newspapers are delivered
to us three or four times a day we cannot appreciate
what it meant to these men, shut off in the wilderness,
to receive news from home which came only
once a year. And it was not all rejoicing which
followed the opening of the mail pouches. For some
men their quota of letters brought sadness. A mother
or a father, sister or a brother, or possibly a child,
had passed away since they had received news the
year before. As these sorrowful items were made
known moist cheeks were seen even among these
weathered and grizzled heroes who had accepted the
call of the wilderness in the vast region where white
men were practically unknown outside the employees
of the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="40a"><img src="images/i_040f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“THE FACTOR WAS THE FIRST MAN TO GRASP<br /> THE HAND OF THE CAPTAIN.”</p>

<p>MacTavish, the Factor, looked the lads over
carefully, wondering what kind of material the
Company’s officer had chosen for him. He was a
man not given to smiles, and through long association
with the Indians and the half-civilized people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of the wilds he had come to cultivate a stern and
hard mien which did not by any means represent his
true feelings. However, when the stalwart lads
from the Orkneys, with Robert in the lead, marched
past, each with his strong box containing all his
earthly goods on his shoulder, a smile was seen to
break through the sternness of his face. Never had
the Company landed better looking lads at Fort
Churchill, and MacTavish felt that if the young men
measured up to their appearance he would be exceedingly
well satisfied. The interest manifested in this
smile was deepened when the captain, who had been
talking to him, pointed out Robert and Will as they
passed and told him of the heroic episode on the
voyage. Around the Factor and the captain were
also grouped some of the Company’s older trappers,
who had been in conflict with the frozen wilds for
many a year. They too saw in the newcomers the
makings of men who were to do things, men who
would meet obstacles and who would overcome them.</p>

<p>For more reasons than one the coming of the
ship was a season of rejoicing to the Company’s
employees. This first day the crew had been given
leave on shore, which was long needed after their
cramping experiences on shipboard, and had been
allowed to stretch their legs and enjoy themselves
as they saw fit. The evening, too, brought its enjoyment,
for a banquet had been spread in which a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of the ship’s cargo had a large place. Naturally the
Company’s officers resident at the Fort, with their
subordinates, were interested in food from the Old
Land brought over by the vessel, and in their turn
the members of the crew were very well satisfied to
dine on brook trout, venison, bear steak, and other
dishes prepared from the food available in the wilds.</p>

<p>While the banquet was in progress an incident
occurred which the young men long remembered.
As became their new station, Robert and William,
with their companions from the Old Land, had been
seated with the Company’s officers. At an unexpected
moment their friend Sandy, who had been
with the crew, was seen edging his way, first through
the red men with their squaws on the outside of
the gathering and then through the Company’s
employees, until he approached his young friends.
It had suddenly occurred to Sandy that this would
probably be the last opportunity he would have to
exchange a kindly word with his rescuers, and before
he was through, even if he had not felt so before,
Robert felt well repaid for any effort he had made
in the old sailor’s behalf during the night of the
storm at sea.</p>

<p>The following morning the scene around the vessel
was one of great energy and apparent confusion. All
hands were busy removing the ship’s cargo, which
was transferred to a large warehouse at the Fort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
For the crew this would have been an enormous task,
but since the horde of Indians who had gathered
from the hundreds of miles around the Fort for this
event of the year found the work somewhat of a
novelty, only two days were occupied. Then began
the work of loading the vessel with its return cargo.
Furs, tied carefully in great bundles, were stored
away in the holds, and after the holds were full huge
piles, which, in their rolled-up state, resembled cord-wood,
were securely fastened by lashing to the deck.
This was the great outlet for the Company’s product,
and annually tens of thousands of the finest skins
were shipped to its sorting and distributing house in
London. Two days more sufficed for this part of
the work and finally, while those on shore waved a
hearty farewell, the ship started on its return journey.
Not the least important part of its cargo were
letters from Robert and Will to the loved ones at
home, giving vivid descriptions of the voyage which
had been the means of landing them in their new
home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<i>NEW EXPERIENCES IN A NEW LAND.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span>, as we have seen, MacTavish’s impression
of the young men coming into his employ had been
pleasing, he was anxious to become more closely
acquainted personally with each of them. MacTavish
was a judge of men. It was his business to
place the lads where they would accomplish the best
results in the Company’s work; in consequence, each
was brought into his quarters and interviewed separately.
In making provision for the allocation of the
men the hard way of the wilds was followed, and
no provision was given for relationships or friendships.
It is not to be wondered at then that when
the allotment of the lads to territory was made
Robert and Will found that their ways were to
separate. Indeed, had they thought to make inquiries
they would have learned that their ultimate locations
lay over a thousand miles apart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="44a"><img src="images/i_044f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">STARTING OUT FROM FORT CHURCHILL.</p>

<p>Fort Garry, now Winnipeg, was at that time one
of the Company’s rapidly growing posts. The Factor
here, Andrew Donald, had written MacTavish,
in a letter which had been sent in care of Pete, one
of the faithful Indian guides, outlining the growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of the Company’s trade in that Section and asking
for assistance. He saw possibilities of materially
enlarging the Company’s trade in his territory, and
stated that he wanted young men with youth, endurance
and enthusiasm, who would be obedient but
who would be possessed of indomitable will and
unconquered spirit. When considering Donald’s letter
MacTavish finally sent for Robert and instructed
him that he had been selected for duty at Fort Garry
and that he was to leave the following day for the
journey of over a thousand miles through the wilderness.
Will had been assigned to a post in a region
further west. It was natural that keen feelings
should stir in the hearts of these sturdy lads when
the final time for separation arrived. They had
hoped that the situation might be otherwise, but not
a word of complaint was heard from either of them.</p>

<p>Duty was their watchword. Discipline and obedience
had been faithfully instilled into them by their
mother in their earlier days. They knew they were
starting out to fulfil their contract. They knew,
further, that the Company’s employees were men
who did not even flinch when their duty was pointed
out to them, and in consequence they obeyed without
a whimper. A simple clasp of the hand was the only
evidence of their feeling at parting, but this did not
by any means give any indication of the regret and
longing which burned within. Taking a few steps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Robert turned and cast a lingering glance toward his
brother. Then, with a farewell wave of the hand,
with faces beaming with love and confidence in the
future, they parted to be swallowed up by the vast
and unknown regions of the Canadian West. From
henceforth the wilderness world was to be their
home.</p>

<p>Imagine, you lads of sixteen and seventeen, the
feelings of this young man, starting out on a new
adventure into unknown country. You lads who are
homesick when you spend a week away from home
on the farm will appreciate the indomitable spirit
that Robert must have possessed at this point in the
journey. Put yourself in his place and imagine how
you would have felt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="46a"><img src="images/i_046f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“WITH A FAREWELL WAVE OF THE HAND ... THEY PARTED.”</p>

<p>After a time Robert discovered he had one comforting
feature. We have spoken of the Indian
guide, Pete, who had been sent from Fort Garry by
Factor Donald. Pete had proved himself one of the
most trustworthy Indians in the Company employ,
and MacTavish had impressed on him especially the
character of the youth who was to be with him, and
had admonished him not only to see that good care
was taken of the young man, but also that he be
taught such things as Pete was capable of teaching
him. Unknown to Robert, also, Pete was given a
note to Donald telling something of the impression
he had made on MacTavish and giving an account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
of his conduct during the voyage. MacTavish had
sized the boy up well and knew, as was true, that
such a story would never come from the lad himself.
Something of the result of the lad’s manly bearing
and his influence on various members of the crew
during the voyage had been transmitted to MacTavish
by the ship’s captain, and this also was
included in the note carried by the Indian guide.</p>

<p>Robert soon came to appreciate the strength and
the knowledge of the country and its conditions evidenced
by his companion. He was exceedingly
thankful again for the fact that during the voyage
he had picked up enough of the Indian language to
be able to converse, though with some little difficulty,
with his companion.</p>

<p>Something of the journey the two had undertaken
may be appreciated when it is known that they anticipated
travelling at least thirty days on foot. While
later Robert was to experience the delights of travelling
by dog-sled, this was impossible at this season
since the winter had not set in as yet. Again, it was
a custom of the Company to start their new men out
on foot, believing that from the incidents of such a
journey they would gain experience such as would
be invaluable to them afterward. For instance, it
was expected that Pete would teach Robert some of
the arts of woodcraft—how to make provision for
spending the night on the trail and how to secure a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
supply of food when such was required. Then,
again, Robert encountered another experience which,
while it was new, brought to him thoughts of home.
To aid in transportation the Company followed the
custom of placing canoes at different points on the
trail, which eased very much and frequently materially
shortened the journey. While Robert was at
home on the water, his first experiences with a canoe
were rather amusing, and in his first attempts to use
his great strength he would frequently have come to
disaster had it not been for Pete’s readiness with the
paddle. It was not long, however, until he became
familiar with the frail birchbark craft, and was able
to make the canoe glide through the water in a way
even to bring admiration to the eyes of Pete, who
naturally was a thoroughly experienced canoeman.
So quickly did Robert adapt himself to the conditions
met with that Pete began to be proud of his
companion and was well satisfied as to their reception
at Fort Garry. Robert was so anxious to learn
that not only did he keep Pete busy by day, but kept
the guide and himself awake sometimes far into the
night talking of methods of trapping and of experiences
so different to what the lad had been accustomed
to in the Old Land. Never so late did they
stay awake, however, but that daylight found them
awake and ready to proceed on their journey.</p>

<p>Robert had been a one hundred per cent. boy. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
was now making himself into a one hundred per
cent. youth. By incessant application he had learned
to master himself. His early training at home had
given him to realize the importance of little things.
All this helped to make him a willing pupil in Pete’s
hands, and instead of feeling himself, as a good
many lads would have done in his place, superior to
the Indian, he realized very shortly how much better
equipped the red man was than he to meet most of
the experiences they were about to enter upon. He
was superior to the Indian in many ways, however.
He had accepted God as his guide. His forces, both
physical and mental, were now being fused into a
product of genuine manhood. When he had played
in the games at home he had played to win, but he
had never forgotten that manliness comes first and
that the mere matter of winning occupies a secondary
place. He had learned the importance of concentration,
and while he perhaps did not realize the significance
of it, he had discovered possibilities within
himself. His ordeals had been faced bravely and
manfully and with an unflinching spirit. Character
stood out boldly on his face. He had begun to
understand that life was a test of patience and endurance
and that he must be continually in action to
develop the best that was in himself. He had
asserted himself as a boy. He was now asserting
himself as a youth. He had come to realize that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
nothing worth while could thrive in a cold heart, and
that if his heart was to be properly warm it must
beat to the impulses that were right, noble and true.
He had learned to start off being properly thankful
every day; that grumbling, growling and criticising
do not help either to make up character or to help
one along. He had learned that sacrifice would help
to lift him a long distance on life’s journey, and
from a religious aspect he realized that he was constructing
a house within himself that he had to live
in; that it was his duty to his God to make that home
worthy and beautiful.</p>

<p>Pete began to appreciate some of these things after
a very short association with his companion. He
had seen the Bibles of some of the white men, but
had never before seen one who so faithfully followed
every day the practice of spending a little time with
the Great Book. After a time Robert told Pete how
the gift had come to him from his mother, and
before many nights Pete of his accord knelt at Robert’s
side when the young man began his devotions
and said his own evening prayer. Companionship
in the temple of God’s great solitude, accompanied
by genuineness of character inevitably leads to
friendship, and so these two rapidly grew closer
together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="50a"><img src="images/i_050f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“COMPANIONSHIP IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD’S GREAT<br />
SOLITUDE ... LEADS TO FRIENDSHIP.”</p>

<p>The forest was a never-ending wonder to Robert
since, of course, he had never known anything of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
it in his island home. The seemingly endless rivers
were another source of awe. He was a lover of
nature, and each day presented to him paintings of
God’s great canvas ever fresh and ever new. There
seemed a friendliness about the birds, the wild flowers,
the trees and the rippling streams which made
him wish sometimes that the sun would always shine,
so that he might always have the beauty of nature
before his eyes. After a time he learned that night
in the forest also has its charm. Even the darkest
night gave forth the softer tones of shadow and
glow. Then the camp-fire threw out wonderful
shadow effects on the trees and appeared to spread
living pictures all around him. With these bits came
also practical things. Wild life was much in evidence.
Deer and moose frequently crossed the path
and at night the lonesome cry of the wolves was
sometimes heard.</p>

<p>When the forest wilds were passed the prairie
again was a revelation to Robert. Of course there
were no houses in those days, and to him it seemed
just a mighty world placed there by the Creator,
ready and waiting for man to sow with seeds of
golden grain. Here again something that Robert
had not even dreamed of made its appearance, since
herds of buffalo were frequently to be seen roaming
at will over the prairie. Then occasionally bands of
Indians came into view, some of these hunting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
buffalo for their winter’s food. As time passed Pete
made Robert acquainted with the various tribes that
were sighted, with their history, and with the dangerous
spirit of some of these.</p>

<p>After they were well on their journey Robert’s
feet suffered from the effects of the long-continued
tramping. He was a sturdy youth, very different
from the wiry and hardened Indian, who had spent
all his life on these paths of forest and prairie. Pete,
however, knew well how to deal with such difficulties,
and it was not long before the lad was able to
get through the day’s tramp without difficulty. At
first, too, the heavy pack caused him considerable
discomfort. As the days passed, however, his
muscles hardened and the pack grew lighter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="53a"><img src="images/i_053f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“THE ANIMALS RUSHED TO ONE SIDE LEAVING<br /> ROBERT IN SAFETY.”</p>

<p>Pete had intended to travel by water, using the
Company’s canoes for most of the journey after
leaving the forest, but the nights rapidly grew colder.
That year the frost set in earlier than usual, and consequently
they were obliged to change their course
and tramp over more of the prairie. This brought
to Robert an experience he never forgot. One morning,
as they tramped along, the prairie seemed suddenly
to be almost black with buffalo, and after a
little Pete explained that several Indian bands must
have started a drive and that the herds were travelling
before them. It was impossible, without making
a long detour, to avoid passing near the beasts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and as they paused, suddenly something seemed to
frighten a section of the herd and it began to rush
toward them. On the animals came, relentless and
irresistible. The two travellers shouted and waved
their arms, but all to no avail. Apparently nothing
could stop the mighty rush. When the animals were
almost upon them Pete advanced a little to protect
his companion, but notwithstanding his efforts to
divert the rush of the herd and his cat-like jump out
of the path of the leaders, he was borne down beneath
them. His efforts, however, seemed to turn the herd
at an angle and they rushed to one side, leaving
Robert in safety. So soon as he could the lad hastened
to Pete’s side and found that, while his Indian
friend was badly bruised and had suffered a broken
leg, he was not dangerously injured. Under such
conditions and three hundred miles from Fort Garry,
their objective, the young man faced an unanticipated
difficulty. However, he measured up to the
situation. First, attention was given to the injured
leg, and here he put into play one of the things he
had learned from the Company’s officer during the
voyage, and thanks to this was able to set the bones
of the leg fairly well, if roughly and at considerable
pain to his patient. Pete, with his characteristic
Indian stoicism, bore the pain without a murmur.
Following Pete’s suggestions, their packs of food
and utensils were carefully gone over and everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
not actually necessary was discarded. Finally, strapping
the pack a little lower than usual, Robert provided
for the additional burden, and picking the
Indian up, placed him on his back and shoulders.
At first the additional weight seemed unbearable,
but at Pete’s suggestion the lad adopted the Indian
lope, which the guide had taught him during the
long journey. This made the burden easier, since
at each step it eased it up from the shoulder so that
it did not seem like dead weight, and was also easier
on Pete. The burden was heavy, but nothing within
reason was too great for Robert when he had made
up his mind. His will-power and unusual strength
made it possible to accomplish tasks that would look
impossible to a faint-hearted youth. Pete was surprised
at the ease with which Robert carried him,
and when he was borne, by the pain in his leg to a
partial unconsciousness, he was carried back to the
days when he was a little papoose and his Indian
mother carried him through the forest paths on her
back.</p>

<p>Never since he had been a papoose, sixty or more
years before, had Pete been similarly treated. His
had been a life of self-protection and of service
given to others. Now, when it was necessary for
someone else to look after him the change was very
marked, but it was none the less appreciated for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
reason, and here again Robert’s early training came
into play. His patient was given every attention he
knew how to give. When he was forced to lay his
burden down at night, prairie hay was gathered and
worked up to provide a soft pillow as well as a restful
support for the broken leg. Again Robert got
a chance to put into play some of the knowledge of
camp cookery he had learned on the voyage over.
While their rations were not varied, these were
added to one evening by a dish of prairie chicken
which Robert was able to get after a good deal of
difficulty with the muzzle-loader he carried.</p>

<p>As can be imagined, the difficulties Robert faced
were by no means small ones. Time after time as
he packed the injured Indian on his back over the
prairie trails he was wearied almost beyond endurance.
Time after time he was tempted to set his
burden down and to give up the struggle. An ordinary
lad would have given up the job before he
started, but determination had been built into Robert’s
heart and soul in his early days at home, and
this found its way out on this long-to-be-remembered
journey. Pete, too, had his troubles. While he was
conscious that the leg was healing, it was a terrible
thing for him to be so dependent on the efforts of
the one whom he had been sent to help. However,
day after day the two persisted, continuing on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
way by means of great determination, courage, and
the finest of physical strength, and toward the evening
of the tenth day Pete, who had been eagerly
watching the landmarks, joyfully cried out that Fort
Garry was in sight. It was with considerable satisfaction
and relief that Robert was able to walk up
to the Company’s quarters and to lay his human
burden safely down.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<i>AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of a party in such an unusual fashion
created considerable interest at Fort Garry. Donald,
the Factor, had been expecting the young man and
his guide for some time. Robert was somewhat disappointed
when, in a gruff, grating, unsympathetic
voice, the man he had come so far to assist inquired
the cause of the trouble. However, he told the story
of the accident in a straightforward, confident way,
and suggested that the Company’s doctor should be
sent for.</p>

<p>When Pete’s leg was given adequate examination
it was found that while the setting was by no means
perfect it was good enough to assure that the Indian
guide would have the use of his leg again. Robert
was not displeased when he was given a bunk close
by his Indian friend, who by this time could scarcely
satisfactorily evidence his thankfulness and regard.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Factor MacTavish at
Fort Churchill had given Pete a note for Factor
Donald. Perhaps it was fortunate that this had
come, since Donald in his first impression was rather
disappointed that one who was so apparently a lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
had been sent him to fill the important place he
anticipated using the new employee for. It is true
that Robert tipped the scales at one hundred and fifty
pounds, but his face more or less betrayed his youthfulness.
Donald knew how necessary firmness and
experience were in dealing with the trappers, and he
judged at first that this lad would be of too mild a
type to force respect with those with whom he was
to come in contact.</p>

<p>More than at first appears lay behind the situation
at Fort Garry. Instead of the Company’s business
with the trappers increasing, it had decreased the
past season. Donald knew that something was
wrong, but as yet had not been able to place the
responsibility. The real reason was that he was a
cold, domineering man, with little thought for the
feelings of others, who believed that he was taking
the best course when he treated the Indians like dogs.
The matter was one which troubled him continually
and naturally kept him in an unpleasant frame of
mind.</p>

<p>It was into an atmosphere of this kind that Robert
entered when he was called for his first interview
with the Factor. He felt the situation was none too
propitious but, as had been his custom, he advanced
quickly to Donald with a pleasant smile and grasped
the Factor’s hand with a grip which, in spite of his
coldness, went to the older man’s heart. Then as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the interview proceeded and question after question
was put to him, he followed his superior carefully,
gazing steadfastly into the other’s eyes. This latter
point in itself was much in the lad’s favor. These
soul windows of Robert’s were piercing deeper into
the Factor’s heart than any glance had ever done
before. After a little time Robert realized this and
became quite at his ease, while the Factor began to
show plainly that he was scarcely a match for the
lad before him. It is only fair, too, to say that when
the interview was over Donald sent the lad away
with a good deal more respect and confidence in his
new assistant than he had had previously.</p>

<p>There were more reasons for this than lay on the
surface. As we have learned, Robert was a lad
whose body and mind and soul were clean. He had
read Donald’s mind and soul through his eyes and
knew at once that he could not have much in common
with the older man, so long at least as the
Factor maintained that domineering spirit which
usually belongs to a lower class nature. Robert was
only a youth, it is true, but instinct and his training
had taught him the principles of right and wrong,
the equality and brotherhood of man, and the
supremacy of God. The Factor was all for number
one, which, put in other words, means that he
was exceedingly selfish. Robert, while he believed
in standing up for his own rights, thought continually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
as we have already learned, of others’ privileges
and was ready to respect them. He had realized
during his comparatively brief connection with the
Company that if he were to progress it could only
come through using a spirit of goodwill, a spirit
which would treat the Indians justly and would love
them.</p>

<p>The following morning, as directed, Robert called
again on the Factor for further instructions. Evidently
the older man had recovered some of his
assurance during the night, for he began again in
the same domineering tones, directing the lad as to
his relations to the Company and the Indians. Robert
let him do most of the talking and listened
respectfully. When he thought Donald had finished,
however, he addressed the Factor pleasantly but
firmly, something as follows:</p>

<p>“I realize, sir, that I am under a contract and that
you doubtless hold a copy of the contract, which has
come from the Company’s headquarters. If this has
not come to you I have a copy with me, calling for
the best services I can give for a term of years, and
will be glad to have you read it. I want to do my
full duty, to use my strength and my opportunities
for the term of that contract in the best interests of
the Hudson’s Bay Company.”</p>

<p>When Donald replied that he had a copy of the
contract, Robert spoke again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I wish, then, that you would give me instruction
as to my duties. If you will not think me bold I
should like to make a suggestion. Of course I do
not pretend to know anything about the Company’s
business, though I have seen something of the territory
surrounding the Fort and of the Indians. I
believe that if you would give me Pete as a guide
and would turn over some entirely new territory to
me and let me deal with one hundred Indians, or
whatever number you think is necessary to get results
from such a territory, I would be willing to stake my
future with the Company on the results. I believe
the work will speak for itself.”</p>

<p>Donald saw immediately that he had been treating
Robert in the wrong way. He realized now that he
was dealing really with a man, and a man in whom
there was wisdom and courage as well as physical
strength. Maturity of mind was also apparent. It
was evident that Robert’s words were not spoken in
any ordinary way. There was a depth and earnestness
to them that the Factor in his more confined
nature could not understand. He realized that new
territory must be opened up if the yearly output
of furs from the Fort Garry district was to be
increased, and the suggestion appealed immediately.
Even with this, however, he was somewhat reluctant
to start such a lad in new territory and to give him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
control over it. He promised Robert that he would
consider the matter.</p>

<p>One difficulty which lay in the way of carrying
out this suggested plan was the accident which had
befallen Pete. The Indian was shortly able to
hobble around on crutches, however, and was apparently
making good progress toward complete recovery.
Robert was surprised and also delighted a
morning or two later when he was again summoned
to the office and informed by the Factor that his
suggestion had been adopted, that a new territory
would be given to him, and that with the assistance
of Pete and one hundred and fifty Indians he would
be allowed to try his hand. It was not thought advisable,
however, that the season’s operations should be
begun for at least a month or six weeks’ time, since
the Indians, who usually came to the Fort to be outfitted
for the season’s trapping, had not yet begun to
come in in sufficient numbers. This turned out fortunately
for all concerned, for the intervening time
was spent to good advantage. Pete, as well as being
a good guide, was a good judge of Indians, and
since he was at once taken into Robert’s confidence
he played his part well in selecting the Indians who
were to make up Robert’s party. And this was not
by any means an easy matter. While the Indians of
the district were, perhaps, as reliable as any in the
Canadian North-West, they were Indians, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
meant that they were only half reliable, and since
they had been handled by previous employees somewhat
along the lines suggested by Factor Donald,
the results of their labors had not been very satisfactory.
Pete made his selections carefully, however,
aiming to get men of a good type physically,
who could at the same time be expected to respond
to just and fair treatment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="63a"><img src="images/i_063f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE PARTY TO COVER THE NEW TERRITORY LEAVING<br />
FORT GARRY.</p>

<p>With the choosing of the men and the making of
the necessary preparations the six weeks passed
rapidly, and one morning the party to cover the new
territory was drawn up outside the fort. With
Robert and Pete and the Indians were half a dozen
dog-sleds with their snapping teams of huskies. On
the sleighs were piled the season’s supplies. When
these had been exhausted the sleighs would be used
to carry back the furs. Pete had seen to it that some
of the Indians were familiar with the new territory,
and these naturally were given a leading place in
the party.</p>

<p>This was a big moment in Robert’s life. It was
really the starting-point of his experiences in his new
life. From this time onward he was to carry the
burden of the responsibility of his party, and this
was fully realized. Robert was pleased when Factor
Donald condescended to come out and bid him good-bye,
to wish the party good luck and a safe return.</p>

<p>The trip of three or four days to the new territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
again gave Robert some new experiences. He
learned for the first time what it meant to travel
through snow with a dog-team, and learned to
admire the ease with which the Indians got over the
snow-laden trail. Here again Pete was a comfort
and aid to him, not only with timely suggestions and
advice, but also in the handling of the Indians, who
even in this early part of the season showed an
unacquaintance with discipline which did not bode
strongly for the success of the expedition. When
the allotted ground was reached the men were distributed
according to a method Robert and Pete had
planned so as to most adequately cover the territory.
Numbers were prepared which were drawn in turn
by each of the Indians, and as the location of the
ground corresponding with the number was reached
the one who held it dropped from the party when his
limits had been defined. Robert and Pete located
their camp as near as convenient to the centre of the
district with a view to visiting each trapper as often
as possible during the winter, to keep tab on the
work and to give necessary encouragement or discipline.</p>

<p>Then the real labor of the season began. At first
the Indians were inclined to take matters easy. Like
others, they misjudged Robert by reason of his
youthful appearance and believed that it would not
be difficult to take advantage of him. They soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
found, however, that underneath his kindliness lay
a characteristic determination such as they had not
found very often, a characteristic which enabled him
to see that each man did his duty so far as he could.
Pete, again, had his part in this. He knew the hearts
of the red men. He had helped some of them when
they had been in trouble, and he knew that, contrary
to the belief of many white men, if his brethren were
treated kindly and justly they could be counted on
to do their part.</p>

<p>It wasn’t an easy task, this one which Robert had
set for himself and Pete. Those of us who know
something of camping will appreciate some of the
difficulties. Leaving their own camp, with the thermometer
a score of degrees below zero, they made
their way, sometimes with a dog-team, sometimes
on snowshoes when the snow was too deep for the
dogs, from camp to camp, waiting until the Indians
returned from their circle of traps. Here encouragement
was given, there admonishment. Here a man
had to be dealt with severely, there a word of praise
cheered another on to further efforts. Many and
many a day the two travelled forty to fifty miles on
foot. Many and many a night they slept without
other protection than a clump of bushes or a snow-bank.
Never a night went by, however, but that
Robert got on his knees for at least a little time
before going off to sleep to say a word for the God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
he served. When circumstances permitted a fire he
spent a few minutes with his Bible, though reading
was difficult with the varying light of the crackling
branches. This had far-reaching effects, for after
one or two rounds of his men their respect for Robert
became so great that almost without exception
the trapper with whom they spent the night listened
attentively and bowed with the lad and Pete when
the time came for the evening devotions. It had its
effect in another way, too, when the red men appreciated
what influence this sort of thing had on
Robert’s life, and that it had a great deal to do
with making him the courageous, just and kindly
youth he was. They realized that he was a man
whom they could safely follow and appreciated that
he could be counted on to repay in full their best
efforts. Thus it was perhaps not surprising that new
life was kindled in the men. They were being treated
as they never had been before, and the ingathering
of furs was most encouraging.</p>

<p>Robert was delighted with the splendid skins which
came to view on his rounds. Particularly pleased
were the Indians when they were able to show him
a black or a grey fox, skins which, in those days,
though not so much as now, were highly prized.</p>

<p>For five months this strenuous life continued.
Then, as the trapping season began to draw to a
close, each Indian left his camp, tied up his furs with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
his blanket, and met at a previously decided point
for the return journey to Fort Garry. Robert and
Pete had gained some idea during their winter’s
travelling of how the work was going, but the success
of the party became more in evidence as the
red men gathered together. The success of Robert’s
policy was at once noticeable. Not one of the
Indians but had had a successful season. The hardships
had been borne cheerfully, largely because of
the fact that unusual encouragement had been given,
and it was a happy band which made their way back
to Fort Garry. How successful this policy had been
was only demonstrated when the trappers from the
other districts had brought in their returns and when
the final checking showed that this band had more
than doubled the efforts of any similar band in other
districts. As can be imagined, Factor Donald was
exceedingly well pleased, and he made his pleasure
practical by inviting Robert and Pete to dine with
him in the Company’s offices. In addition to this he
had a special dinner spread for the Indian band in
their own camp in the Company’s quarters. This
experience had taught Donald a lesson. It was being
forced into his understanding that these Indians had
worked with an energy and with a spirit which had
not previously been seen among the Company’s trappers,
because they had been handled with a spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
kindly interest and had been treated as brothers
rather than as slaves.</p>

<p>After the success of his first winter it was not surprising
that the following year Robert was given
charge as a sort of Sub-Factor of all the trappers
sent out from the Fort, and while they were gathered
at the Company’s quarters he talked to them
night after night before the various expeditions
started, throwing into them the same spirit he had
been able to give to his band the previous winter.
The men who had been out with him did good missionary
work also. They told of his treatment of
them, how interested he had seemed to be in their
work, of his cheerfulness under difficulties, and how
he had worked just as hard, if not harder, than any
of them. Lastly, they did not forget to tell of the
prayers and the Bible reading, which had seemed to
have its own effect. This year, too, new territory
was again opened up. More Indians were employed,
and, as a result of Robert’s efforts, the season was
very much more successful than any had been previously.
All this was, as may be expected, very
pleasing to the Company’s officers at headquarters.
Fort Garry, from a condition of backwardness, had
jumped in two years’ time to one of the most profitable
posts in Canada. Donald, of course, was given
credit for the improved conditions. As a matter of
fact, the greater part of this was due to Robert and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Pete. However, efforts of this kind cannot long
remain unnoted, and from various sources other
than Donald something of the lad’s part in these successful
operations found their way to headquarters,
and after a little time he was placed in a position of
further responsibility and with an increased wage.
As he had anticipated, back in his Orkney home, his
efforts had not been in vain. Thus far efficiency,
reliability and faithfulness to duty had been his
watchword. Coupled with this was the continued
thought of helpfulness to others. While his promotion
was naturally very pleasing, he was not ready
to accept this as entirely the result of his own efforts,
and in consequence made a strong plea with the
Company’s Factor on behalf of his friend Pete. At
first Donald demurred, but the young man had made
his methods and his policy so successful that his plea
finally carried, and ultimately a letter was written
the head office, not only recommending an increase
in Pete’s salary but also that all the trappers be given
a larger allowance for the furs they brought in.
Robert waited for the year which necessarily passed
before a reply could be received, and then the long-looked-for
letter came which agreed to the increase,
largely by reason of the splendid returns which had
been made by the Fort Garry trappers.</p>

<p>The increased pay worked wonders. Those who
had seen the Indians at work previously thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
they had done about all that could be expected of
them in the first year under Robert’s supervision.
The red men realized, however, that in addition to
the kind treatment they had been receiving their
efforts had been duly rewarded in a financial way,
and they worked in consequence as Indians had
never been known to work before. Pete, too, was
naturally very much delighted at the reward which
had finally come to him for his faithful service.
However, it had another effect. Although Pete was
still hearty and able, he was getting along toward
the age of seventy, and the severe hardships he had
undergone, as well as the accident he had suffered
when guiding Robert to Fort Garry, had begun to
tell on him. With the Company’s allowance he had
sufficient to retire from such active duties as had
been keeping him engaged for so many years and
to take life easier. Thus, after a time, Robert was
forced to part with his first and best friend of the
wilderness. Pete did not forget the principles of
right living Robert had taught him by precept and
example, however, and became something of a missionary
among his Indian brothers.</p>

<p>Robert spent two more seasons very successfully
in the Fort Garry district, and then realized one day
that the old contract under which he had enlisted in
the Company’s service was no more binding. And
with the realization that he could be free if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
wished naturally came new thoughts and a new outlook.
Robert felt that he had a good deal to be
thankful for. During the four years of his experience
with the Company he had not been ill for a
single day. He had had many narrow escapes,
through which he seemed to be guided by an unseen
hand. The life, too, seemed to exert something of
a fascination over him, and he had grown to regard
the Indians very highly for the good qualities which
were apparent when they were properly treated.
Other thoughts, however, came to him at times,
since he still forwarded half of his pay to his parents
in Scotland, it was only natural that he should think
of them at times, and sometimes touches of home-sickness
came to him, feelings which those of us who
have experienced will appreciate took more spirit
and character to bear than other kinds of illness.
While his mind wandered off and across the sea his
thoughts turned, as a real man’s ideas will, to other
things, and at times he dreamed dreams of a real
home such as he might expect to have some time in
the future where he would have a helpmeet who
would be sympathetic and whose burdens he might
have a chance of sharing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<i>STIRRING ADVENTURE IN THE NORTH.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nowadays</span> two brothers in the Canadian West
who had any esteem for one another could communicate
in several ways and would probably write
each other very frequently. It was natural that at
times Robert’s thoughts should turn to his brother
Will, but aside from occasional stories which came
to him through the Indians and other employees of
the Company, no definite word had been received.
Once or twice, it is true, he had written to his
brother, but in those days and in a country so vast
there was no certainty of mail delivery, and it appears
probable that the letters were never delivered. The
same conditions prevailed in regard to other youths
who had made up the original party from Scotland.</p>

<p>In his fifth year in the new land, at a time when
such an arrangement would be convenient, Robert
secured leave of absence with the idea of travelling
north to visit his brother. He journeyed by foot
and by dog-sled to one of the northernmost forts,
fully twelve hundred miles from Fort Garry, finding
occasional news of his brother as he passed from
fort to fort on his journey. When he arrived at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
brother’s headquarters, however, he was told by the
Factor that Will had been sent on a prospecting tour
into new territory. Robert was anxious to follow
his brother, and would have done so had he not been
assured by the Factor that it would be a practical
impossibility to reach him, since Will had already
been away two months and was expected to be away
fully six months more. While Robert was sadly disappointed
his trip had not wholly been in vain, for
he learned from the Factor’s lips, as he had not been
able in any other way, how successful his brother
also had been, how his services had been appreciated
by the Company, and how through heroism, faithful
service and obedience he too had been given due
promotion.</p>

<p>On his way back to Fort Garry Robert ran into an
experience which again showed his mettle. Following
along the trail late one afternoon he was held up
by a band of about two hundred Indians who, for
some reason, had started on the war-path. The
moment the white man was seen he was surrounded.
At first he thought he would have no difficulty with
these men, presuming that he could handle them as
easily as he had done his own Indians in the Fort
Garry district. In a moment or two, however, he
saw that these natives had no respect for the white
man. He knew from their faces and from the glare
of their eyes that they meant anything but friendliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
toward him. It was useless to try to escape.
He laid down his pack and stood erect, facing the
leader with a fearless and undismayed look, and as
the painted red man approached Robert stepped forward
with outstretched hand and smiled. The chief
was nonplussed. He had expected a craven attitude,
and was so surprised that he clasped Robert’s hand
and was forced to return the straight look in the eye
which the young man gave him. His surprise was
more manifest when Robert addressed him in a language
very similar to his own, explaining where he
was going and why he was on the trail at that time.
After a moment or two of conversation Robert was
able to gather enough information to learn the name
of the chief and know the nature of the band. It
was part of a roving tribe which had made itself a
terror in the northern districts and which had
accounted for the fate of many a trapper. Robert
knew well what he might expect if he was not able
to get the situation in hand. His faith did not leave
him, however. He sent up a prayer to his Heavenly
Father for aid which he well knew was needed, and
felt God was nearer him than ever before. For a
moment, perhaps, he felt physical fear, but then he
got himself together and knew that with God’s help
he was master of the situation.</p>

<p>Robert did his best to convince the chief that his
errand was peaceful and that he should be allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to proceed without being disturbed. After a moment
or two the chief left him, apparently to consult with
some of the other savages. To keep hold of himself
under the strain Robert untied the pack which was
lying at his feet, ate some of the pemmican which
largely made up his supply of food, and stepped
toward a fire which was burning to one side, hoping
to get the attention of the members of the band.
Perhaps by reason of the novelty of the situation,
or possibly because they were forced to respect the
manner in which he carried himself, they listened
while he told the fierce-looking warriors of the Great
Spirit on high who had come down to be in the midst
of them and who was close by his side. For a
minute or two he went on with his story, trying as
strongly as he knew how to change the hearts of the
savages, and while he could see that an impression
had been made on a few, most of them were still
sullen and apparently anxious to carry out their
earlier intentions.</p>

<p>While he had been talking to them he had been
watching them carefully, as he had learned before
he had to do with Indians, and finally he noticed one
giant warrior gradually making his way to the rear
of the band. Suspecting treachery, he suddenly
shouted at the Indians in a voice like thunder telling
them that the Great Spirit was by his side and that
if they dared to injure him they would suffer. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
with a sudden turn he faced the red man who was at
his back and who was ready with upraised knife
to spring on him. As the Indian leaped Robert
caught his wrist with one hand and with the
other grabbed the savage by the throat in a vicelike
grip and held him right over the blazing fire until
he writhed with agony. It wasn’t easy for him to
do this. While outwardly he was stern his heart
was tender, and he felt toward the Indian as a father
to a child. He realized, however, that if his life was
to be saved a stern example must be set. After
inflicting pain over the fire for a moment or two,
while the rest of the tribe stood off, in awe that a
white man could so control one of their mightiest
warriors, he threw the savage on the ground to one
side, from which the Indian leaped quickly to his
feet, and without looking around ran off down the
trail. Apparently he had been forced to believe
Robert’s story that the Great Spirit was in league
with him. With the disappearance of one of the
number in this fashion the remainder of the band
vanished quickly, and in a moment or two Robert
fell on his knees and thanked his Heavenly Father
for the help that had been given him in this time of
stress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<i>NEW DUTIES LEAD TO LARGER TESTS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> Robert’s return to Fort Garry a new incident,
one which was to lead him into unexpected
and far-reaching new paths, developed. When he
returned to Factor Donald he was informed that a
dangerous criminal had been captured and brought
to the fort, and that it was to be someone’s duty to
deliver the offender to Little York, on the shore of
Lake Ontario. It is perhaps easy to understand why
Donald had selected Robert as the probable guide.
He knew that the young man could be depended on
in every way. He knew that the journey would
be a long and trying one, and knowing something
of the prisoner, understood just what would be
demanded of the leader of the expedition. Had he
known that his choice would mean the loss of his
most helpful assistant he would probably have risked
placing the prisoner in the charge of some other
employee. However, he was responsible for the safe
delivery of the criminal to the authorities at Little
York, and he intended that, so far as possible, his
duties in this regard should be fulfilled. The journey
under these conditions, as could be anticipated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
did not appeal to Robert. He had liked his work
of the past winters, and he was anxious to go ahead
with his Indians to carry forward the Company’s
interests. When Donald told him, however, what
would be expected of him and that he would be serving
the Company just as directly in this way as in
the other he made no protest, and while the outlook
for the long trip with a companion who could not
be congenial was anything but pleasant, he felt that
he must be true to his duty, must obey the orders
given by his superior, and agreed to assume the
responsibility.</p>

<p>When he got a chance to look at the prisoner a
little time later he appreciated more of what the
situation meant. The criminal was over six feet
and built accordingly. Apparently he had roamed
in the wilds until the effects of civilization had been
lost on him, and he was now more like an animal
than a human being. However, Robert had undertaken
to do the job and he intended to carry it
through. Preparations were made for the long journey
of more than fifteen hundred miles, and good-byes
were said to the few trappers and Company
employees who were not already in the forests for
the winter season. A surprise came to Robert when
he was invited to take dinner with Factor Donald
the last night before his departure. While he knew
that this man had appreciated his work he had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
been able to get under the Factor’s cold attitude.
This last night, however, proved that the young
man’s character had won a place, for Donald spoke
to him as he had never done before and said good-bye
to him almost tenderly.</p>

<p>By this time Robert had become an expert dog
driver, and he was not displeased when he was given
a team of the finest huskies owned by the Company.
His prisoner, with hands and feet securely fastened,
was placed on the sled with the provisions and necessary
supplies. The man had refused to walk, saying
he would rather freeze first, so that there was nothing
to do but transport him in this fashion. Everything
went well the first day. The dogs, being fresh,
travelled well, and the prisoner, although he had not
been informed of the party’s destination, did not
cause particular trouble. He was sullen and refused
to talk, but, pinioned as he was and tied to the sled,
was not in a position while the party was travelling
to be the occasion of much disturbance.</p>

<p>The first night in camp with such a prisoner was
not a particularly pleasing incident. Robert had
made up his mind during the day, however, to try
the same tactics on his prisoner as he had tried with
the Indians the first winter of his experiences in the
North-West. He prepared as good a meal as was
possible under the circumstances, partially loosening
him so that he could eat without difficulty, served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
him first, and gave him every consideration that was
possible. The man’s nature, however, was very evident.
He remained sullen and vicious, and when he
did speak punctured his sentences with oaths, which
told something of his thoughts and the kind of a life
he had been living. Apparently, too, he had misread
his man, thinking that because his guide was youthful
in appearance that he could be browbeaten and
made afraid.</p>

<p>After supper Robert made his prisoner as comfortable
as possible. While the chains were still left
upon his ankles, they were loosened so that he could
take short steps and yet could not walk at all rapidly.
Then Robert heaped up the fire and, following a
decision made earlier in the day, thought it would
not be safe for him to go to sleep, but sat by the fire
and after a little time assumed the attitude of sleep.
At the same time he watched the prisoner from the
corner of his eye. After a little time he saw the man
glance at him carefully and slyly, and then noted
that he was working himself into an upright position.
A moment later the chains on the man’s ankles
rattled and like a flash the villain was on his feet and
moving toward the fire. It was well for Robert that
he had been watching, for it was evident from the
man’s eyes that he intended to give no mercy. When
the man was almost on him Robert jumped up with
his gun in his hand and faced the surprised villain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Get back!” he cried. “I have tried to treat you
decently, but I see you do not appreciate it. You
won’t have another chance either at me or to escape
while you are in my charge. It will be a grind and
a fight from here on.”</p>

<p>Following this policy Robert watched his prisoner
continually. During the day he loosened his bonds
sufficiently to let him get the necessary exercise, but
took good care that he had a weapon at hand conveniently
while he was doing so. At night he chained
him more closely so that he could not rise alone. In
this condition he was placed by the fire so that he
would not freeze. For the first night or two Robert
had gone without sleep and intended to do so, knowing
that his prisoner must be carefully watched, so
long as he could.</p>

<p>With the hardships of the trail, however, he soon
learned that he must have the requisite sleep to make
him fit for travel the next day. He was careful,
however, to keep some of the dogs between the prisoner
and himself. By this time the huskies had
begun to respond to his kind treatment and he knew
that he was not likely to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Robert thought he had learned something about
snow and cold in the North-West, but as the days
passed by and he began to journey along the north
shore of Lake Superior he found an unusual situation.
For several days the sun seemed scarcely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
show its face and snow fell day after day without
let-up. The cold, too, increased in severity, and with
all this the travelling was becoming very hard, and
as they came into heavier wooded sections another
danger appeared. Occasionally during the day Robert
had seen skulking wolves following the party at
a little distance, and as these increased he knew that
the packs were hovering about in considerable numbers.
At night, while they were resting, the young
man had little fear, for it was easy to build huge
fires, which he knew would keep the animals at bay.
Again, he was little troubled for himself or his dogs,
but he was disturbed for his helpless prisoner, whom
he intended to deliver, according to instructions, at
Little York.</p>

<p>With this came another trouble. While the dogs
had been going splendidly, the continual travelling
in the deep snow had been very trying, and with the
added weight of the prisoner this condition was
accentuated. Finally the dogs refused to go further.
Robert did his best with the splendid old leader, who
in his turn tried to pull the team through the huge
drifts, but his efforts were without avail. The idea
occurred to him of reasoning with the prisoner, but
he concluded that such attempts were useless, since
the villain continued to return only oaths for his
kindness and had apparently made up his mind to
make his escape if the opportunity ever offered itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
There was apparently little of the human in this man.
He would not respond to kindness in any form.</p>

<p>Robert prepared camp for the night, hoping that
a rest would fit the dogs for another day’s travel,
and this time the animals were given special care.
As he measured out their food his thoughts flew
back to his old collie dog in his Orkney home, and
he remembered how anxious that animal had been
to serve him. He realized that not only did the success
of his expedition, but also that his own life
depended on the dogs and that it was almost more
than could be expected that the animals could cope
with conditions such as they had met with the last
few days for very much longer.</p>

<p>Another morning came, still without the sun. The
sky was heavy and black and snow continued to fall.
Around the little band every twig, every branch, was
carrying its burden of white crystals. The cedars,
balsam and spruce, as well as the larger pines, were
dressed in robes of white purity, and the less sturdy
of these were bending low under the weight of their
mantle. Another day of struggle brought them
somewhat nearer their goal, but again the dogs
became excited, and when the expedition stopped for
the night Robert noticed that the wolves were nearer
than they had been before. The next morning when
the time came to start out it was found that two of
the dogs were unable to go further. They had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
their best and more could not be expected from them.
Robert then had to perform a painful duty, for it
was necessary to put these faithful brutes out of
their misery. To somewhat counterbalance the loss
of this pulling power everything that could possibly
be gotten along without was taken from the pack
and left behind. They travelled slowly, but kept
moving on and on through the deep, newly-fallen
snow.</p>

<p>In this northern region at this season of the year
the days were exceedingly short, and since it was
impossible to travel after dark the hours of struggle
were comparatively brief. After another day or two
Robert was convinced of the necessity of still further
care in regard to rations, and the prisoner was
informed that his allowance would be cut in two.
His only answer to this came in curses, surely an
evidence that there was little of tenderness in his
make-up. At nights the dogs were buried deep in
the snow, asleep. The prisoner could sleep well, but
while the sternness of the struggle made some sleep
necessary for Robert, the difficult situation bothered
him a good deal and made his sleep anything but
regular. He was worried, for instance, over the outlook,
wondering whether it was at all probable that
the duty he had undertaken would be fulfilled. He
was worried by the constant aloofness and sullenness
on the part of his prisoner, and he was worried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
again by apprehensions as to his powers of dealing
single-handed with the wolf pack, which he knew
was daily becoming bolder.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as he stood by the huge fire of
burning logs which he had gotten together to keep
the wolves away during the hours of darkness and
which it was necessary for him to replenish from
time to time, his thoughts drifted away from the
troublesome ones which usually impressed him and
involuntarily, it seemed, he began to plan for the
future. Then, in a moment, as he stood looking into
the flickering flames, an attractive face, of a type
which he thought would be ideal as a companion in
life, as a loving helpmate who would make life worth
while, appeared to him. Perhaps it was not surprising
that thoughts of this kind gave him new determination,
and he decided at the moment that if he
was given the strength to reach Little York with
his prisoner he would resign from the Company’s
employ, would build a cabin for himself and look
for a sweetheart, one whom he could love and help
through life’s journey and who would love him and
help him in return.</p>

<p>His dream met a sudden interruption. The wolves
had been more troublesome than usual that night,
and occasionally, as he had seen their eyes gleaming
in the circle outside the camp-fire, Robert had made
good use of his shotgun. Suddenly, with howls from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the pack, one animal larger than the rest made a
dash straight for him and in his own way called to
the others to follow. Fortunately, Robert’s gun was
ready, and the first wolf fell in his track. Here
again came into play the stamina and the self-control
which had been bred into Robert in the island home
and which had been developed during his years in
Canada. An ordinary man, or one less experienced,
would have flunked under the situation, but Robert
kept cool and made certain that whenever he was
able to fire the shot would have the expected effect.
Finally, when two or three animals closed in and he
could not handle his muzzle-loader quickly enough
to be of further service he used a huge, burning
brand and, swinging it around his head in fiery
circles, drove the band back from the little camp.
After this he built up the fire freshly, and the new
blaze served to keep the animals away until day
dawned.</p>

<p>The next day the struggle was resumed, and in
spite of the difficulties, in spite of the cold, in spite
of the protest on the part of the dogs and the prisoner,
mile after mile was gained on the long journey.
The day had been quiet so far as storm was
concerned, but in mid-afternoon the sky suddenly
turned black until the heavens seemed dropping to
earth. Then, as the little party passed out of a patch
of woods, howls were heard as though coming from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
everywhere, and Robert realized that the pack of the
night before had been largely reinforced and that he
would have to meet another testing period. This
time he knew that the situation would be more trying,
and with a view to getting what help he could
he threw the harness from the dogs, knowing that
they would defend themselves bravely. He looked
to the prisoner to see what aid could be expected
from him, but again the character of the man showed
itself in his face, since abject fear was stamped
thereon. He was desperately afraid. Robert knew,
however, that if it came to the worst this human
brute would be of some service, and in his sense of
justice he knew that the man should be given a
chance at least to fight for his life. Besides, he had
undertaken the duty of landing the prisoner alive at
his destination, and he readily understood that unless
every possible effort were made in the present crisis
it was probable that his duty would not be fulfilled.
The prisoner was rather surprised, and for once a
spark of gratefulness came to his eyes when the
chains binding his arms and hands were removed
and the axe placed beside him. Robert placed his
back to a tree where he could watch the prisoner and
at the same time keep the wolves from surrounding
him.</p>

<p>He was ready just in time, for the hungry animals,
with hanging tongues and fiery eyes, seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
rushing in from every direction. Crack! went the
young man’s gun, and as quickly as he could load
and fire a wolf fell. No bullets were wasted. Every
one told. Don, the old leader of the dogs, took his
share in the fight also, challenging the leaders of the
pack and taking a place directly in front of the
young man. On and on the animals came, pushing
one another forward, climbing over the bodies of
those which fell at the shots from the gun. After
a minute or two of fighting old Don went down.
Robert was in process of loading. He jammed the
charge to the bottom of the barrel, drew out the ramrod
and fired into the middle of the pack; then seeing
that his leader must be saved and that time could
not be wasted to re-load, he dropped his gun,
grabbed his axe and waded into the pack, swinging
the weapon right and left. The prisoner for
once was proving himself useful. This time he was
fighting for his own life. He knew what the outcome
would be unless he bore his share of the responsibility,
and he showed that he knew well how to
swing an axe. Wolf after wolf fell from the blows
of the heavy weapon. In one instant, when he had
felled a wolf at one side, another sprang for his
throat. Robert had been trying to watch the man
out of the corner of his eye (for he knew he could
not trust him) while he had been struggling with
the wolf pack, and had his opinion as to the strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and ability of the prisoner in a country of this kind
confirmed. With seemingly more than human
strength the huge fellow tore the wolf from his
throat and threw him back among the others, at the
same time administering a blow of the axe with the
other hand to another which had pressed in on him
from the right.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="88a"><img src="images/i_088f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“WOLF AFTER WOLF FELL FROM THE BLOWS.”</p>

<p>For minutes the struggle continued. Don and the
other dogs fought valiantly, but the numbers were
overwhelming, and looking around him Robert saw
that the members of his team were helpless, most of
them lying dead. At the moment he did not realize
the situation, but had one been looking on the
impression gained would have been decidedly grim.
The clothing of both the fighting men had been badly
torn. Gashes had been made in various places on
their bodies. Their hands were wounded and bloody.
Robert, however, was as full of fight as ever. Finally
there came a headlong rush of the wolves, which
with difficulty was beaten back, and then a lull. Half
the pack had been disposed of and the remainder
apparently had not the courage to continue the
struggle. With tails between their legs they one by
one withdrew to the shades of the forest.</p>

<p>When this danger was over Robert was sure from
the glint in the prisoner’s eyes that he was face to
face with a new one. While the man could only
move slowly on his feet, he took up a threatening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
attitude. Robert had been prepared to thank him
for the part he had taken in the struggle, and even
in the face of this threat held his temper accordingly.
Advancing toward the prisoner, but keeping
out of reach, he asked him calmly to submit to having
the irons placed on his wrists again. The answer
came back quickly and viciously in the negative.
With an oath the villain said:</p>

<p>“I have been fighting for my life. I will fight you
now for my freedom. It is up to you and me to
settle our accounts.”</p>

<p>Decision came to the young man like a flash.
Before the fellow could move he grabbed the handle
of the axe with a grip of steel and at the same time
dealt the man a crack on the chin which laid him for
the moment helpless. While the giant was unconscious
the irons were again fastened on his wrists,
and while he was returning to consciousness a fire
was kindled in a section of the wood removed from
the scene of struggle, to which he was dragged and
made as comfortable as possible on a blanket. When
he came to Robert was eyeing him steadily, and
when he saw that his man could understand him he
said, firmly:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="91a"><img src="images/i_091f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“YOU’RE A COWARD, AND YOU’RE GOING TO BE<br /> TREATED LIKE A COWARD.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I had to punish you, but you know
yourself that it was necessary. If you will behave
yourself the rest of the way I will treat you kindly;
but you will be watched, and if you try any tricks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
like that last one on me you will get your deserts
just as you did that time. You may think you are
a strong man, but you are not a brave one. You’re
a coward, and you are going to be treated like a
coward.”</p>

<p>The night was spent at this point in the woods,
and Robert rose early to try to size up the situation.
During the night two of his dogs returned to him.
One, while somewhat injured, was able, after a
supply of food was given him, to do part of his
share of the work with the sled. Before leaving the
place Robert could not resist the temptation of going
to have a last look at the old leader, Don, who had
fought so bravely for his master in the struggle of
the day before. With these thoughts naturally came
a remembrance of his old dog back in the Orkney
home, and this led to thoughts of his mother and
father and brothers and sister.</p>

<p>When the start was made Robert saw that he was
face to face with assuming most of the burden of
drawing the sled. The two dogs were of some little
help, but without Don to lead them they needed continual
attention. Again Robert made an appeal to
the prisoner, suggesting that if he would behave himself
and would travel ahead of the sled the chains
on his feet would be removed. The only response,
given as usual in foul words, was that not one step
would be travelled. Robert saw then that the prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
expected and hoped that he would collapse and
that thus freedom would come to him. The fellow’s
calculations were wrong, however. He did not know
the endurance of the lad, nor did he realize that
there was a heart within this young body which did
not know defeat. After he had cut down still further
the load of supplies, Robert strapped the prisoner
still more securely and then, putting the dogs ahead
of him where he could use the whip when necessary,
he got himself into the harness and started on again.</p>

<p>Then, as so frequently happens when men struggle
against difficulties and when the crisis seems to be
past, nature seemed to smile and give her aid. The
sun came out again and played with its rays on the
mantle of snow. With the moderating weather and
the heat of the sun the snow packed better, and this
made the drawing of the sled much easier. During
the day, also, two or three deer crossed the trail and
a fortunate shot brought a very welcome food supply.
Just in time, too, for the provisions were almost
exhausted. This incident impressed Robert, as had
not occurred to him before, with the generous provision
God had made for man in the forest solitudes.
He understood, as he had not done previously, that
a food supply was generally ready and that it only
required man’s own efforts to secure what he needed.</p>

<p>With the more favorable weather, too, and with
an instinctive feeling that he was approaching civilization,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Robert began to appreciate something of the
bits of nature in this new district. As another day
or two passed they began to travel through almost
unbroken forest, rough and rocky sections where the
trail, though better than it had been before, showed
occasional signs of travel. Animal life, too, began
to be more frequent, and although it was winter time
almost every foot of the trail showed traces of
animals, small and large, going about as instinct
directed.</p>

<p>For several days the sled with its heavy burden
was drawn along the trail. As the days went by
Robert anxiously consulted the map which had been
given him by Factor Donald, and while it was difficult
to follow this with any accuracy, he knew by
certain signs that he could not now be far distant
from Little York. One day two Indians were
encountered. Robert had no wish to meet strangers,
and particularly Indians, until his prisoner was safely
landed at the destination. Therefore, when he saw
that they were not members of any tribe he was
familiar with and realized that in all probability
their language would be different from that to which
he was accustomed, he tramped past them without
stopping. He saw how carefully they eyed the prisoner,
but finally they passed by without commenting.</p>

<p>After another day the prisoner was surprised when
Robert did not make the usual halt for camp in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
evening. The moon was full, and after such supper
as could be prepared the young man kept on through
the night with only a short rest as the light became
dim during the early morning. On the following
day plainly-blazed trails leading through the yet
unbroken forest of pine and oak monarchs such as
he had not previously seen were met with, and here
Robert stopped, resting, to look up at these huge
giants of the forest towering to the skies. That
afternoon a log cabin was seen. Robert realized how
a lone pioneer had blazed his way into the forest
solitude, how he had hewn out a home for himself
and his loved ones in the heart of the forest, and at
the moment there returned to him his dream by the
camp-fire in the north-western district, and he wondered
and renewed his determination to go into the
forest shortly and to build such a cabin for his future
home. He would have liked to have visited the
cabin, from whose chimney a welcoming smoke
appeared, but with him duty was always first and the
landing of his prisoner safely was uppermost in his
mind. After a few minutes’ rest he started onward
with quickened pace, and since the trail seemed to
furnish a downward slope the way from this on
seemed easier.</p>

<p>The following morning Robert noticed further
signs of habitation. He passed here and there strips
of clearing, and about noon came out of the forest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
After the several days travelling through the
unbroken sweeps of woodland it was like entering
a new world, and coming over the crest of the hill
Little York lay below and in full sight. His goal
was reached. As his eye swept over the hamlet
below him, the largest centre he had seen since leaving
his Orkney home, he saw the bright coats of the
soldiers standing out against the snow as they paraded
on guard along the fort to the west, and he
noted also the windmill standing at the edge of the
lake to the east. Beyond a stretch of water to the
south lay a barely-wooded sandbar.</p>

<p>Naturally, some little attention was attracted and
comment was made as the strange party passed
through the streets which, to Robert’s eyes seemed
unusually busy. Several tried to halt him to inquire
his business, but as always duty came first, and only
stopping to inquire the way to the jail, he passed on
without hesitating. His charge was soon landed in
custody and his responsibility for the prisoner turned
over to the jailer.</p>

<p>Only when his responsibility was removed did
Robert realize what a burden it had been. His task
had been a most trying one, but he had certainly
done his part manfully in dealing with the prisoner.
While his patience had been tried in every way, he
had been as kind as reason could demand. His great
desire had been to kindle a spark of love in the prisoner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
soul and if possible to raise him from the
bestial spirit which seemed to possess him. While
he had failed in this he knew that he had done his
duty, and as he stepped from the jail with his responsibilities
in this incident and to the Company ended
he felt as though a huge burden had been removed
from his shoulders. After finding comfortable quarters
he made his way to the Company’s representatives,
deposited his papers and received the salary
due him. Then, without further consideration, for
it will be remembered he had made up his mind in
the matter, he wrote a letter of resignation and in it
thanked the Company for its kindness. At the same
time a letter was sent forward to his mother and the
loved ones at home telling something of the experiences
of the last few weeks. Thoughts of them
brought remembrances of his old friend Sandy, and,
while he had no idea of the sailor’s whereabouts at
this time, another letter was addressed in care of
the captain of the old ship, in the hope that it would
finally reach the sailor friend. This done he went
to his room and for hours slept the sleep of one who
has won and who has an easy conscience by reason
of having gained a victory by doing his full duty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<i>SANDY’S VISIT HOME.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> to this time we have been following Robert
and his brother almost completely. It will do no
harm, however, to leave them for a little time and
to hark back to another home in the Old Land.</p>

<p>Robert’s influence on Sandy, strengthened by the
heroic rescue, was a lasting one. Many times during
the return journey the old sailor longed for the companionship
and the sturdy manhood association of
the lad he had learned to regard so highly. With
these thoughts and with his changed life there naturally
came into his heart feelings and longings he had
not known for years, and with these came a renewed
love for his home and parents and a longing to see
his dear old mother again, an experience which he
could not remember since he had left home in the
first place. When the ship docked on her return
journey, therefore, Sandy was not long in breaking
his long-continued connections and in starting for
the old home. He was wise enough to realize, however,
that his mother would scarcely like to see him
as he was, and out of the savings of his pay a new
outfit of clothing was bought, and with a clean shave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and his hair trimmed he took the quickest way he
knew of getting home. On the way his misgivings
were many. He had not written home for over
thirty years, and since his mother did not know of
his whereabouts it had been impossible for her to
write to him. Had he known how his mother had
longed for a letter and how his father had tried to
cheer her when no news of their boy was forthcoming,
he would not have been so indifferent; but, like
a good many boys, when he got away from home
these things did not trouble him much, particularly
when he was busy in new experiences which took
up the greater part of his time. His home lay well
up in the Highlands, and, on the stage journey, over
and over again his thoughts went back to the day his
mother said good-bye to him, and he wondered with
a good many doubts whether she would still be alive.
On the way, too, he remembered that this was the
first journey of any length he had made on land
since he had left home, and this remembrance was
emphasized when he missed the rolling of the sea
and was made very uncomfortable by the bumping
of the stage over the hilly roads. He missed, too,
his old friends among the crew, with whom he had
associated for so many years, and who in spite of
their roughness had become like brothers to him.</p>

<p>Wishing his visit to be a surprise he left the stage
a little distance from the village, and walking toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
home along the neatly-kept road he was surprised at
first to meet many people whom he did not know.
Some of the younger folk, it is true, appeared to
have something familiar in their faces, but for a time
he forgot he had been away for thirty years and that
no one would be likely to remember him. Finally he
came to the turn in the old, familiar road and began
to climb step by step up the old hill leading to the
old, familiar cottage. He remembered as well as if
it were yesterday the fun he and the other boys had
with their sleds on this hill, and with this came in a
flash vivid remembrances of the homespun clothing
and the warm mitts his mother had made for him.
He remembered again, too, the kisses which had
been given him as a little chap when he came back
from his sleigh-rides to be cuddled up in front of
the big fireplace. As he came up over the brow of
the hill his step involuntarily quickened and his longings
increased. For the moment he forgot all about
his forebodings, and it seemed that he couldn’t
quickly enough get to the old home to clasp his dear
old mother in his arms and to look into his father’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Now he was able to look down into the little valley
on the other side of the hill where the cottage stood.
Yes, it was still there. The same old thatch roof
came into view, though more moss had gathered on
one side than had been there. A few minutes later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
he came to the gate between the low walls and looked
up the path leading to the door of his boyhood home.
Then his fears came upon him again with a rush.
The old gate had fallen down, the hinges falling
away from the decayed posts. Along the path where
his mother had in his boyhood days carefully looked
after the flowers, weeds were flourishing. The climbing
rose over the porch, which he remembered so
well, no longer bloomed. He waited for a moment,
half expecting that his old dog would run out as he
used to in former days to bark him a welcome, but
the place was quiet with the quietness of a deserted
spot. The door of the old home was open. For a
moment he hesitated, with his heart in his mouth.
Then with a hesitation which he could not understand,
he walked in and looked in vain for the smiling
face which had been framed in the doorway and
for the outstretched arms which formerly had gathered
him into them. Half-dazed, he looked through
the broken window in the back of the room, as
though he expected to see the familiar form of his
father in the garden, but no one was there. The
silence and loneliness was complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="100a"><img src="images/i_100f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“FOR A MOMENT HE HESITATED, WITH HIS HEART<br /> IN HIS MOUTH.”</p>

<p>Then Sandy spent one of the bitterest moments of
his life. Great tears ran down his cheeks, and with
bitterness he reproached himself for having forgotten
one of the most precious gifts this earth gives a
man, a loving, patient mother and a kind, careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
father. Then, kneeling for a moment in front of
the old fireplace where, as he remembered now but
had forgotten so long, his mother had taught him in
the old days to say his prayers each evening, he
made a resolution that with God’s help he would not
disappoint his parents again, but that he would be
true to his mother’s prayer as she had told it to him
in the note enclosed in the old Bible, and would live
so that he would be ready to meet them in a better
land when his time came.</p>

<p>After a little time, Sandy realized that his regrets
could do no good now, and putting them so far as
possible behind him he left the silent, cheerless home
and made his way again to the little village. Stepping
into the little postoffice, his heart was gladdened
at once by the sight of the postmaster who,
though up in years, was still young in heart and
spirit, and here at least was one person who remembered
him, for he was recognized at once and was
invited to stay over-night. Then, when the postmaster’s
duties for the day were done, the old veteran,
who had known the history of every family in
the village and throughout the surrounding districts,
whose duty it was to keep a record of the births,
marriages and deaths, told Sandy something of the
experiences of the past years. The old man thought
that it would not do the wandering son any harm
to suffer a little, since he did not then appreciate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
extent of Sandy’s repentance. Many and many a
time he had been touched when he had seen the sadness
and disappointment on the face of Sandy’s old
mother when he had been forced to tell her, “No,
there is no letter to-day.” Often he had been asked
to go over the mail again, just to see if he hadn’t
possibly missed a line from the boy, Sandy. Had he
known Sandy’s address, he himself would have tried
many a time to get in touch with the wandering son,
but, of course, he had been just as helpless as the
mother.</p>

<p>Far into the night the old man talked to the sailor,
telling him purposely how week after week during
the thirty years of his absence the old mother had
come, hoping against hope for word of her son, and
he said, “It hurt me to have to send her back every
time with a heavy heart. She was a good mother
though, my boy. Never in all those thirty years did
she speak an unkind word of you. Her thought was
always that Sandy was a good boy and will be a
good man, that he would write if he could.” Then
the old man went on, even more pathetically: “The
last time your mother walked to the office, Sandy, I
knew she would never return. She knew this also.
The way she lingered, the way she longed for a letter,
all told plainly that it would be her last call, and
after she had gone up the road a little piece she
turned and came back again to ask me if a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
came that it might be sent on to the old home. Your
mother lived for you from week to week, Sandy,”
he said, “and her life clung to the hope of a letter.
At last her strength was not great enough to be told
again, ‘There is no letter from Sandy.’”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="103a"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“NO LETTER FROM SANDY.”</p>

<p>The old man went on further, though he saw that
the tears were now running unrestrainedly down
Sandy’s cheeks. “The love your mother had for
you has made a better man of you,” he said. “I do
not believe she could have walked home that last
day if I hadn’t told her that possibly for some reason
we didn’t know you were up in heaven waiting for
her. She looked at me so earnestly then and her
tears flowed freely, as they did often, and finally
she said:</p>

<p>“‘I hadn’t thought of that. Sandy must be in
heaven or he would write me.’</p>

<p>“After that she left the office with a lighter step
and with even a smile upon the face that before had
been cast down.” After a little, when Sandy managed
to get hold of himself again, he was told how
his mother had been laid away in the old village
churchyard five years before. Also that his father
had followed her in the next year, and then the old
man said:</p>

<p>“There is no one, Sandy, to put up a stone even,
to mark where they are laid. You know how poor
we all are here. Some of us would have done it if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
we could, but we had our own loved ones to look
after.”</p>

<p>While it added a good deal to his pain, Sandy felt
that it was only his duty to visit the little churchyard
the next day, and there he was shown the graves of
the parents who had loved him so long and faithfully.
Glad he was then that he had brought with
him the pay he had received from his last voyage.
A stone such as he knew his old mother would have
been proud of was ordered, flowers were placed on
the graves, and every mark of respect arranged for.
Even so, Sandy felt in his heart that this did not
begin to atone for his neglect for the long years gone
by, and for many months he stayed in the village,
talking with those who had known his father and
mother, keeping the flowers fresh on the graves in
the churchyard, and trying to feel himself back in
the old home. After a time Sandy went back to his
seafaring life. When his old shipmates saw him
they exclaimed at the wrinkles in his face and wondered
what had happened during his absence to make
him look so much older. At first he said nothing,
but in the midst of the voyage, when the long roll of
the sea or the roar of the wind brought back memories
of his experiences with the heroic lad Robert,
he told to some of his mates the story of the pain
which had come to him during those months in the
old home in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Sandy lived like a real man for the rest of his life.
He was strong and true and clean. He read his
Bible and as best he knew he tried to follow the path
laid out for him, so that some day he would be sure
of meeting his father and mother, when the great
call came, in the place where he knew they had gone
already.</p>

<i>HOPES REALIZED AND THE JOURNEY
ENDED.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> man with an intense love for nature,
who had heard and answered the call of the wilderness,
who knew the silent places, the forest giants,
who associated with the birds and the rippling
streams and revelled in it all, could not be content
even in the little town which York was in those days.
If Robert had lived to-day he would not have been
content to spend his life in the heart of a city. He
would have been an engineer or a surveyor or something
which would have taken him out into the
mountain solitudes or into the forest. He would
have loved to struggle with the elements, to have
studied nature’s moods and to have watched her
ever-changing pictures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="106a"><img src="images/i_106f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“ONE MORNING A YOUTH STARTED OUT ALONG<br /> THE MISSISSAGA TRAIL.”</p>

<p>Early one morning a youth, now grown to twenty-one
years and more stalwart and sturdy than when
we first met him, started out with a good-sized pack
on his back along what was known as the Mississaga
trail. In his pack was his all, a tent and an outfit to
allow him to live in the forest. This was arranged
so that he could make his home where night overtook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
him, pack up again by daylight and start on
again. He wasn’t on a trapping expedition this time,
however. When the lad had left his Orkney home
four years before he had had a definite purpose in
mind which had stayed with him steadfastly during
the intervening time. The main thing he had come
to Canada for was that some day he might have a
home of his own and be in a position to help those
whom he had left behind. His mind was filled with
pictures of the log cabin he had passed on his way
to Little York, and he was setting out now to search
for a suitable location so that the picture might be
materialized. The Mississaga trail ran westerly along
the lake shore from Little York in about the same
place where the Toronto to Hamilton highway now
provides passage for thousands of motors. How different
the scene was then, however. Nowadays we
sweep along on this concrete pavement as luxuriously
as in Pullman cars, at twenty to thirty miles an hour.
Robert passed over the trail, which was not by any
means so straight as the highway, and up and down
the hills, which at that time no one ever dreamed
would be smoothed up by engineers a hundred years
later, slowly though steadily, all the while on the
lookout for a location for his home-to-be. His ideal
included several things. First of all he wanted his
cabin on a height so that he could have a commanding
view of the water such as had been so great a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
delight in his boyhood days in the far-away Orkney
home. He wanted a place, too, where he could have
nature’s hills and valleys—glens with the wooded
giants which he had learned to look upon for protection
and to furnish the fuel which he knew was so
necessary in the Canadian climate. Robert’s eyes
were brighter than they had been during his journey
from Fort Garry a little time before. He had nothing
now to worry him. His responsibilities were
light. His mind was full of plans and hopes of the
finest type for the future, and as, during the hours
which passed he formulated further plans, his face
lighted up again and again with the joys of anticipation.
Again, his notice was attracted by the
splendid forest trees all along the trail. He thought
of the value these magnificent trees would show if
they could only be taken across the sea. Little did
he imagine, however, that years afterward his own
son would be engaged in just such a business, having
these knights of the forest cut, dressed and transported
to his father’s old home. Perhaps reasons
which Robert did not appreciate and which he could
not understand were driving him through the forest
trails. The ordinary young man would have wanted
to stay in the town where such life and liveliness as
were known in the new country were evident. Robert
had liked life in Little York, some of which
appealed to him very strongly. For instance, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
not seen a white woman since he had left his Orkney
home until he walked around the streets of the village
the day after his arrival. It had been a pleasant
experience to associate with good men and women
who talked his own language and who liked to converse
about matters he was familiar with across the
sea, but underneath his longing for the comforts and
pleasures these conditions offered there lay a spirit
and a longing which drove him unwittingly out on
the trail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="109a"><img src="images/i_109f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“HE COOKED HIS SUPPER OVER THE FIRE.”</p>

<p>As he passed along he occasionally met Indians.
These seemed better men physically than those he
had known in the West, but their dialect was entirely
different and they were not able to understand him
when he tried to speak to them. He wanted to know
the conditions of the country, whether there were
settlers ahead of him, where the type of location he
had in mind was likely to be met with; and when he
kindled a fire, after pitching his tiny tent, and stood
looking into the coals, after his plain and humble
supper had been prepared and eaten, when the
thoughts of his ideal cabin and his prospective home
occurred to him, he seemed to see dancing in the
shadows a girlish figure beckoning him on. With
this came pictures again of the interior of the cabin,
with a warm fireplace where he could sit during the
long winter nights and where happiness would be
supreme, where the maiden would be the queen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the home and where he would be the king. So
engaged was he with these thoughts that he did not
notice the fire was dying down until the howling of
wolves was heard around him, and with this the
snarling of the wild cats. Quickly the fire was
kindled anew, and with his feet toward the blaze he
lay down to enjoy pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>In the morning, as he passed along the trail, he
began to come into pleasing sections, and here and
there he cleared away the snow between the trees
and chopped into the freezing earth to examine its
quality. He was in no hurry, because when he had
located and erected his cabin he wanted to be finally
satisfied. However, he knew from the size of the
timber and the abundance of the forest growth that
the land where he was standing would, if cleared,
grow splendid, golden grain. Occasionally, too, he
saw another cabin, which told him that pioneers were
selecting locations in the district. As the trail
approached the lake he saw log cabins on the other
side of a clearing, and looking over the tops of the
trees from a hill he noted a sweep of sand across a
narrow section of the lake, with a good-sized bay
beyond it. He was gazing for the first time at what
we now know as Burlington Bay. He liked the
situation, perhaps for one reason because it was
more like his Orkney home than any part of the
country he had travelled previously. He decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
that somewhere in the district would be the ideal
spot for his home and for a time, because he wanted
to be careful and satisfied about it, he scouted
through the district. As he went a little further
west he discovered a section of rolling land, of hill
and dale, very much like his island home in the
Orkneys. Climbing one of the higher hills he found
a commanding view of the bay and also found a spot
where a cabin could be built amid the beauties of the
forest. Amid the silence the ripple of water came
to his ears, and walking a little distance down the
hill he came to a spring of pure water rising out of
the earth as cold and clear as crystal, so that even
the winter’s frost could not prevent it flowing freely.
He was satisfied. He knew in a moment that his
search was over. He had discovered his idea for the
future, for the home of the queen of his dreams.</p>

<p>Next morning Robert lost no time in beginning
to carry out the practical part of his dream, and here
again was put in practice some of the training he
had received in the wilderness in the Hudson’s Bay
Company’s employ. He selected a score or more of
the forest giants in the vicinity and went to work
to fell them. During his short stay in Little York
he had made himself familiar with the principles
used in building these useful log homes and consequently
knew exactly what to do. For two or three
weeks he was engaged in squaring the logs and cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
them to the proper lengths, and finally, after
having made arrangements with a few of the nearest
settlers, he was able to get his home together.
Robert had a bigger outlook than the ordinary settler
of that day. For instance, his cabin was built
twenty by thirty feet, which was considerably larger
than those which were usually erected. He made it
one and a half stories in height and provided for a
living-room with two comfortable bedrooms on the
first floor. Needless to say, he did not forget the
fireplace in one end of the living-room, and as this
was constructed he saw pictures of the splendid fires
that would be found there in the future and which
would cast a cheerful glow throughout the cabin.
Again, other settlers had been satisfied to build their
homes from the timber most convenient. Robert
had chosen for his walls oak logs and the roof was
covered with shingles of split oak. Through all this
he thought of the queen of the home he had not yet
met, who in the future was to occupy this cabin home
with him. Day after day he continued to work.
Every crack was carefully chinked. The log floor
was hewn as smooth as hard muscle and skill could
make it. He remembered that someone else would
have to keep this floor clean in the days to come, and
he wanted it as smooth as possible so that this duty
would be light.</p>

<p>The home itself finished, his attention was turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to the preparation of furniture, for in those days the
pioneer had no opportunity of sending an order to
the departmental store for everything he wanted.</p>

<p>In all this, of course, Robert was thinking primarily
of the queen of the home-to-be, but provision
was made as well for a welcome for the chance
stranger, for he intended that hospitality of a true
kind would be one of the features of the new home.</p>

<p>With these labors the winter had passed and summer
was rapidly approaching. The sun was growing
warmer each day and the generous mantle of snow
was slowly but surely disappearing. Glancing occasionally
down toward the bay through the little
clearing which came as a result of his efforts during
the winter, Robert noted that the ice was breaking
up. A few weeks later the ground seemed to be
alive with spring flowers all around his cabin, and
the young man’s heart was full of joy and gladness
in the results of the successful working-out of the
early part of his plans. The birds, too, were plentiful
and continually told their story of gladness in
their own way.</p>

<p>In spite of his happiness, however, he had a continual
feeling that something was lacking. At times
he was lonesome. He wished to share his good fortune
and he felt that he would not only be happier
but that he could do better work if he had someone
to work for—someone to share his happiness. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the evening came and his work was done he would
sit in his cabin with his face in his hands and gaze
into the glowing ashes of the fire that had been used
for the preparation of his evening meal. He longed
to hear the light step on the floor behind him. He
longed for someone in the cabin to call him by his
name. At first his struggles with the trees had been
new and had kept him busy. He had found it exciting
to chop away into the heart of one of the giants,
to watch it tremble and then start faster on its downward
journey, this to end in a final crash. But this
had become commonplace. The camp-fires, the old
tenting-places, the rippling streams, the forest with
the birds and flowers, were all right in their place;
but now he had become a real man there was a place
in his heart for something bigger and stronger than
any of these. Sometimes he felt that he had been
very foolish in completing his cabin without making
some provision for the one who was to share it with
him, but again he felt that all in good time the lack
would be provided for. Finally, as he sat in the
cabin thinking his usual thoughts on a Saturday
evening, his mind turned toward conditions in his
old Orkney home, and he realized fully the real
home that had been. He saw, as he never had
before, that the light of that home had been mother.
It was mother who kept the family waters calm. It
was she who had lighted the spirit of love which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
illumined that old home. In the midst of these dream
fancies he was brought from his thoughts of the
loved ones across the sea with a start when it seemed
that suddenly a maiden’s voice called to him, clear
and sweet, saying: “Robert, how is it that you are
here alone? I have been dreaming too, and I have
heard a call that was borne to me in the whispering
of the wind, in the branches in the trees, by the song
of the birds as they fluttered through the forest.
These have been singing songs of love to me, songs
full of hope and cheer to which my soul responds.
Let me light up your life. Let me have a share in
your heart.”</p>

<p>Robert was at a loss to understand the vision, but
he felt that it was real. Naturally his last few years
of life in the heart of nature had made him a believer
in the spirit world, and while he could not understand
nor explain the circumstances of the message
which had come to him, he felt that there must be
a reason for it. He felt, too, that it was an evidence
that some of his longings were to be answered and,
as can be anticipated, he went to sleep that evening
very happily.</p>

<p>This feeling persisted when he arose the next
morning, Sunday, and as the sun rose clear and
warm and threw a golden gleam of light through
the forest he knelt in a fervent prayer of thankfulness.
When he sat down to his morning meal he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
did not forget also to give thanks for his food, for
he realized that he owed all to his Heavenly Father
for guiding him to this verdant spot and for helping
him up to this time, and with his prayers his hope
was kindled anew.</p>

<p>That morning, for some reason which he could
hardly define, Robert felt an impulse to follow some
unaccustomed paths through the forest. He had
made visits to his neighbors along the trail back to
Little York, but had been so busy that he had not
followed the paths in any other direction. This time
impulse moved him to travel north-west, and after
he had covered about five miles he met a newly-blazed
trail leading away from the main pathway.
Perhaps it was curiosity, perhaps it was impulse
which led him to follow this, but after a little time
his heart suddenly jumped in his throat, and he felt
himself quivering with more hesitancy than he had
felt even when he was face to face with the Indians
in the far North-West, when he heard a girl’s voice
clearly and sweetly singing a morning hymn his
mother had sung back in the old Orkney home, evidencing
a love for the Great Father on high. As
he listened he knew that the voice was approaching,
and peering through the trees he finally caught a
glimpse of the first woman he had seen in the district.
It was not surprising that to this youth, who
had scarcely seen a white woman, much less spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to one since he left the old land, the voice should
seem like that of an angel from heaven or as sweet
as the birds that sang among the blossoms in the
trees. Naturally the last thing Robert wished to do
was to alarm the maiden, so he walked slowly in her
direction, looking through the trees as though he
had not seen her. In a moment, however, the young
woman caught sight of him and stood motionless,
waiting for him to approach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="117a"><img src="images/i_117f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“WITH A PRAYER OF THANKFULNESS IN HIS HEART<br />
ROBERT GREETED HER.”</p>

<p>In these days, when we live under the restrictions
of social usage, the matter of the first meeting of a
youth and a maiden is usually a somewhat formal
one. Usually, too, anything but serious matters are
discussed on such an occasion. Conditions were different
with these two. Here was a youth who had
scarcely spoken to a woman of his own class during
the years since he had left his father’s home, a boy.
Now a man who had established his character and
had made considerable of a name for himself in a
new land, he was having his first words with a
maiden, who likewise had had little to do with men
of her own age and who latterly, outside of the
members of her own family, had not known what
it was to mingle with young men. With a prayer of
thankfulness in his heart Robert greeted her, and
while he knew all in a moment that this was the
maiden of his dreams, he was practical enough to
note the beauties of face and figure and also to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
that the young woman of the forest was dressed in
a becoming, if simple, new gown.</p>

<p>In her turn also the young woman was experiencing
feelings which had heretofore been unknown.
She too had had dreams. She too felt that in this
young man whom she had by chance met so appropriately
that Sabbath morning lay the realization of
her visions, and, as happiness such as she had not
before known came to her, it suddenly seemed that
all the songsters under the skies had gathered in the
trees about and were now singing their sweetest
songs for them. The girl’s cheeks were fair and
perfect as a rose. Her sparkling blue eyes seemed
to Robert as brilliant as stars in the heavens. She
was indeed for him the forest queen. For a moment
they looked into one another’s eyes with an understanding
which surely was suggested in realms above
the earth, and then naturally, if somewhat shyly, she
invited him to her home, noting that it was just a
mile further along the trail. “Father and mother
would welcome you courteously, as all the people in
the district do.”</p>

<p>Robert had always been very much at home in the
forest. How he walked had not bothered him very
much, but as now he stepped along the path with her
whom he knew to be the queen of his heart he felt
very awkward. But, as they passed along the trail
and talked of the flowers, the birds, the trees and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
beauties of nature, the mutual sympathy which was
soon very evident shortly remedied any feelings of
diffidence either of them had, and both felt that the
other was surely a kindred spirit. Arriving in a
little time at the cabin door, the maiden invited
Robert to enter, explaining a little diffidently, “This
is a stranger, mother, whom I met on our trail.”
The mother’s hand was at once extended and in her
eyes shone a welcome which Robert knew to be sincere.
After a moment, when the mother inquired his
name, he suggested somewhat casually, “If you
would please me, madam, just call me Robert.”
Accepting the suggestion as it was meant, the father,
in a matter of fact way, in his turn remarked,
“Well, Robert, where did you come from? Are you
settled down around here?”</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed to make Robert feel
heartily at home. Very soon he found out that the
father was the son of a United Empire Loyalist who
had left his home in the United States when the
rebellion against British rule occurred thirty years
before and made his way up into another section of
Canada. The son, when he had married and when
his family was beginning to grow up, had started
out to find a fortune in this new district adjacent to
Burlington Bay. Robert learned also that within a
few miles of him in another new district there were
a number of other loyalist families. He had heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
stories at home of the sacrifices made by these splendid
people and was very well satisfied that he had
been directed to cast in his lot among them.</p>

<p>One of the many things Robert had been taught at
home was that to be a good conversationalist one
must be a good listener, and although he had done
very little talking since he had come to Canada he
remembered his parents’ advice, particularly at this
time when he was anxious to make a good impression
in the home, and for a time he sat listening
attentively and showing a deep interest in the conversation.
The father in turn was greatly impressed
with the young man. He liked his open countenance
and his modest and unassuming manner and, with
so attentive a listener, he was moved to tell a good
deal about the early experiences of his father’s
family in the United States and of the journey north
from New Jersey. Had he known of the adventures
through which the youth had passed during the
last few years, how his endurance and pluck had
been tested to the uttermost, he would have considered
his experiences hardly worth telling about.</p>

<p>In the meantime the young woman, with several
others of the good-sized family of boys and girls
of the home, had been busy preparing dinner, and
shortly this was announced. What a dinner it was!
To us who are used to several courses, cooked under
most convenient conditions, it might not have seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
so appetizing, but to Robert, who for several years
past had been doing the most of his cooking himself
and had lived most plainly, it surely seemed a banquet,
and truly it was wholesome and abundant. To
the young man, who had been living largely on dried
meat and flap-jacks, a boiled dinner of cabbage, potatoes
and meat, tastefully seasoned, cooked to a finish,
with an inviting-looking pudding and a well-filled
plate of cookies, all served on a spotless tablecloth,
was surely a treat. Then it all seemed so much like
his mother’s cooking that it was with difficulty that
the tears were kept from running down his cheeks.
It was but natural, too, that the mother of the home
reminded him in many ways of his own dear mother.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed all too quickly, and when he
felt that he must go Robert said good-bye with a
heart so full of love with the world that it appeared
to be brighter to him. The grass was greener, the
birds sang more sweetly, and even the path under
his feet seemed softer than when he passed that way
before. The maiden of the home came to the door
with him, after he had said good-bye to the others
and after the mother had given him an invitation to
visit them often, and had given him a firm but gentle
grip of the hand which sent a thrill to his very soul.
When their eyes met as they had done that morning
a look of understanding and appreciation passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
between the two which told Robert more than words
could have done.</p>

<p>Robert’s head was held a little higher than was
usual when he walked to his cabin that evening.
Here was the answer to his hopes and his prayers
of the last few weeks. His helpmate was now within
reach, and what a helpmate his newly-found love
was! On Monday morning he entered on his conflict
with the forest with a new spirit. He had
worked hard before, but now he worked with a
definite object in view. Land must be cleared to
grow food and to provide for the support of his
bride, and as his sturdy muscles drove the ringing
axe into the trunks of the trees, with every blow the
words seemed to ring through his heart, “It is for
her.” Again at times he would pause for a moment
and listen, and then there seemed to come to him,
faintly ringing through the forest, the notes of the
hymn he had heard so sweetly sung the Sunday previous.
He appreciated, too, the fact that something
more than his own sense had been guiding him along
the trail that Sunday morning, and often during the
week he was on his knees in thankfulness for the
blessings that had been given him.</p>

<p>You chaps who have been through something of
the same circumstances will appreciate how hard it
was for Robert to stay away from the newly-discovered
cabin even for a week. Every evening when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
his day’s work was done, even though he was tired
enough to drop, he felt an almost unbearable impulse
to walk the few miles which separated his cabin from
the other home. He felt, however, that the good
impression he had made the previous Sunday should
be preserved, and he tried to work all the harder so
that the temptation would not be so strong. It was
not surprising that he woke early the following Sunday,
and it was not surprising also that after his few
regular duties were done he was particular to spend
some little time looking after his personal appearance.
Clothes were not a matter of much import
those days and his appearance was something which
had not heretofore bothered Robert very much.
Now, however, with his new experience was coming
a new feeling that he must be worthy of his new-found
love in every way, and also he was anxious
to appear as well as possible in her eyes. The weather
was threatening that morning, but the young
man could not have been held away from the other
home by iron bars. As soon as he dared he started
off through the forest, and again the birds sang
sweetly to him and the flowers looked specially beautiful,
as they had done on the previous Sunday.
Arriving at the cabin he found the door open and
knocked with some little diffidence, stepping to one
side and waiting for an answer. In a moment he
was welcomed with a pleasant smile by the one he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
wanted most to see. She, too, had been spending some
little time over her dress. Her rosy-golden hair was
neatly coiled around her shapely head. Robert had
learned her name on his previous visit, when her
mother had addressed her simply as “Mary,” and
in consequence he greeted her naturally and simply
with a “Good-morning, Mary,” and in reply she
called him just as naturally by his name.</p>

<p>This time, as was to be expected, Mary’s father
and mother were anxious to learn something more
about the young man who had happened so curiously
into their home, and the opportunity he had wished
for but had not had previously to tell them something
of his experiences was thus afforded. As
simply as he could without emphasizing unduly his
own deeds, he told them how he had left his home
in the Orkneys with his brother, under contract with
the Hudson’s Bay Company, and something of his
experiences since that time. Lest they should feel
that he was boasting, he hesitated to tell them about
the adventuresome happenings of the last two years.
Rather he dwelt upon the people at home and talked
of his mother and father and of the conditions there.</p>

<p>While he talked Robert’s eyes followed Mary
about the home while she, as a good housewife
would, looked after varied duties. While perhaps
he did not realize it he was interested in seeing what
kind of a home was provided, and it was exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
satisfactory to him to see that everything was tidy
and in its place. Evidently peace and love ruled
supreme, and this was the kind of a home, where the
parents of the children lived happily, where a man
finds rest and where he learns to love and cherish
the one who shares his daily duties. To Robert it
seemed that Mary was the jewel of the home. He
saw that she relieved her mother so far as she could
with the household duties, and he noted also that she
had been well trained to look after these as they
should be done. With the realization of all these
things the joy in his heart increased. Occasionally
glances passing between them gave him further satisfaction
because he felt that the feeling of kindred
sympathy which had been evident on the day of their
first meeting had continued, that they were both
beginning to know what love meant. When they
spoke to one another they continued to use the names
Robert and Mary just as naturally as though they
had known one another since childhood.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed these pleasant visits continued.
After a little time, when Robert felt that
he had made his position in the home known, he felt
that he could make his visits more frequent, and
after a little time, also, it became the custom for
Mary to accompany him part of the way home when
his visit was over in the early evening. Of course
Robert came back when it was time for Mary to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
in the cabin, and after lingering for a few moments
to get a last glimpse of his sweetheart, walked away
sturdily to his own cabin, dreaming of love and
future happiness.</p>

<p>One of the pleasant incidents of the summer days
was a visit Mary paid with her father and mother
to Robert’s cabin. They were surprised at its size,
since it was even larger than their own home provided
for the good-sized family it housed. Then,
while Robert drew the father to the top of the hill
to show him the outlook and also to give him an idea
of the work he was undertaking, Mary and her
mother, as they believed Robert would wish, examined
the interior of the cabin. Again they were
surprised when they saw all that had been done to
make the place a real home. The neatness of the
cabin, considering that it was looked after by a man,
was unusual. They appreciated, too, the careful
work the young man had done in putting together
the furniture which was placed around the three
rooms, and saw that he had made every provision
he knew how for the partner who was to occupy the
home with him. They all appreciated that this, too,
was to be a real home, and the father and mother,
understanding how sturdy was the character of the
young man who had prepared it, had had little hesitation
in granting his request when, a short time previously,
he had come to ask them for their daughter
as his bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Between Mary and Robert themselves the utmost
sympathy prevailed. It was hardly necessary to discuss
the matter of an acknowledgment, for as they
associated with one another during Robert’s visits
and walked together when occasion permitted, the
kindredness of thought and feeling was so apparent
that each knew their future was bound up in the
other. It was a case where God had seemed to direct,
where surely a guiding hand, stronger than man’s,
had been in evidence.</p>

<p>The wedding day was set for October 16th in the
year 1819, and again nature seemed to be decked
for the occasion. The forest foliage, while in a dull
season, still showed bright hues. What wild flowers
still bloomed in the fall of the year were used to
decorate the table, and enough of these remained to
provide garlands for the bride to wear. The wedding
dinner was provided almost altogether by the
newly-cleared land and by the animals which God
provided in the district.</p>

<p>Simplicity prevailed everywhere in those days.
There was no thought of a wedding journey. After
the ceremony Robert led his bride slowly from her
home to the new one. Over the trail they went
quietly, thinking thoughts of the happy future; over
the trail upon which they had first met less than six
months before; and, as they passed, the spirit of love
seemed everywhere, and in the peacefulness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
day there seemed to lie a promise of a peaceful and
happy life for the newly-wedded couple. When they
arrived at the door of the new home it was opened
by the hand of him who was now husband. The
cabin was entered, Mary tripping over the doorstep
like a queen, and as Robert welcomed her, as he had
never been able to do before, he realized that the
cabin had now become a real home.</p>

<p class="caption">“THUS WERE ROBERT’S EARLY HOPES AND PLANS REALIZED.”</p>

<p>Thus were Robert’s early hopes and plans materialized.
With that day came the fruition of most of his
dreams, and as the days and weeks and years passed
by and the fine spots in his character, the foundations
of which had been so well and truly laid, developed
further it was seen that they provided for a
real happiness. Mary, too, had her part in providing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the peacefulness and comfort of a happy home. She
was a true helpmate, and with the years there came
to him the blessings that come in a home. Sons and
daughters were given to them, fourteen in all, and
while these brought added cares and responsibilities,
they brought added joys. With the course of time
Robert extended his holdings. After the first few
years his land had been practically all cleared, and
as his sons were born to him he was anxious that
provision should be made for their future. He
worked hard and introduced the boys also to a life
of similar industry, though he and his wife were
careful to give them such education as was possible
in the neighborhood. Population also grew rapidly
in the district, and when Robert’s sturdy principles
of character made themselves known among the
neighbors various honors such as come to a similar
type of man were given to him. He was a man of
whom the district was proud, a man who accepted
such responsibilities as were given him seriously, a
man who was sure to see that things were done when
they were undertaken. Robert did not escape difficulties.
Even in those days business transactions
were not altogether free from vexatious happenings,
but he pursued the policy of honesty and straightforwardness
which had been so carefully drilled into
him by his father and mother, and by reason of this
was always on the right side. People knew that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
word could be depended on, that it was as good as
his bond, that when he said a thing he meant it and
that it was right.</p>

<p>Mary, in her turn, occupied a place relative to her
husband in the community. She was a leader among
the women, often going to the homes of her neighbors
to provide what comfort and help was necessary
in times of trouble and stress. She was always ready
to give advice and help. Many and many a bride
came to her for help in her difficulties. Many and
many a young man was given good advice when
making plans for his future.</p>

<p>Thus was happiness provided for and love ruled
alone. For twenty-seven years the two journeyed
along life’s pathway happily and truly, and then,
while Robert was yet a stalwart man and apparently
in good health and strength, he was one day suddenly
taken ill and received his call up the long, long
trail which has no ending here on earth. It was a
blow to him when he realized that the end had come,
particularly when it came so suddenly and unexpectedly.
It was hard for him to leave his helpmate
in life. It was hard, too, to have to say good-bye to
the home which had been so much to him. He felt,
too, that he had a good deal in life yet to do, but as
the end came near he seemed to appreciate that the
One who called had more work for him to do somewhere
else in a better place, and through his tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
he answered briefly, “God’s will be done.” And as
he journeyed on up the trail he did not go blindly,
for the pathway was lighted up by the love which
had been born in his soul as a youth and which by
the faithful following of duty had been developed
into a flaming torch which was to light him continually
along the pathway.</p>

<p>One of the sturdy hero’s hopes had not been
materialized. It had been a deeply-impressed wish
in his heart that some time the opportunity should
be provided to return to his father and mother in the
old Orkney home. In this he had been disappointed.
His parents naturally had preceded him in death, and
his life had been such a busy one that the considerable
journey back to the old home had never been
provided for. However, his wish did find realization
in another way, for he found his father and
mother waiting patiently for him when he reached
that land “fairer than day” from which the call
had come for him.</p>

<p>For forty years Mary, as Robert’s widow, carried
on his responsibilities, and with her family of fourteen
these were by no means light. Never once did
she flinch, however. As Robert had prayed with her
during his lifetime, so she was now given strength
to pray, and as she prayed she knew that her prayers
were answered. She did her best to bring her children
up as their father would have had them reared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
When the time came she led them to the church in
the neighborhood, and Sunday after Sunday, as she
walked along the roadway to the church service,
holding her children by the hand, she sang the same
song which Robert had heard when he had first met
her, back on the trail years before. When she had
lived her life as God intended she, too, was called on
high and was again placed at Robert’s side to live
together as they had done on earth, but in the happiness
that is only known in that great land beyond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW “KID” MADE GOOD<br />

<small>A STORY OF THE CANADIAN LUMBER WOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> are you doing here, Kid?”</p>

<p>This was the greeting that came to a lad of fifteen
who, late one afternoon in the month of October,
about thirty years ago, walked into one of the lumber
camps which were then located along the French
River in Northern Ontario. He was a light-haired
boy with blue eyes showing a natural honesty
beneath them, and with a bearing that would command
the admiration of any real man.</p>

<p>The greeting came somewhat forcibly to the boy,
particularly when it was given by Scott, the foreman
of the camp, who was known throughout the
district as a man who demanded the best from his
men, though he treated them well in return, and the
lad to whom he spoke was surely in touch with new
experiences. To a boy who scarcely knew what hard
work really meant, who through force of circumstances
was forced to come up against work which was
ordinarily tackled by physical giants, this meant new
as well as trying experiences. It was a well-known
fact that anyone who looked for employment in a
lumber camp must become one of the crew and must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
abide by the well-defined though unwritten rule of
those days of passing through the rather rough, but
usually good-natured treatment, such as all green,
first-year hands, were subjected to. This policy was
followed in the belief, as prevails in a good many
other institutions and industries, that the sooner a
green hand got his bumps the quicker he would
become a full-fledged hand. Charlie, the young man
our story is concerned with, had found his way to
what was known as Camp No. 2. Here Scott, the
foreman, had seen many years’ experience in the
lumber camps and in driving logs on the most difficult
water. Furthermore, Scott had gotten his early
training under one of the hardest bosses that ever
wore shoe leather—a man firm as steel and cold as
an iceberg. Naturally he had absorbed a good deal
of these qualities, but with all this he had a kindly
spot in his heart, under a rough exterior, for the
green hand who seemed to have in him the right sort
of stuff, particularly if the new man were willing.</p>

<p>Probably Charlie would have chosen some other
vocation had his circumstances been otherwise, but at
that time and in that part of the country nothing else
seemed open to him. Only a few weeks before,
through the death of his father, the family’s
resources had been swept away, and when the mother
and the smaller children had been left without support
it seemed to the oldest son that it was his duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
to get into something at once which would provide
for them.</p>

<p>Charlie looked Scott in the eyes after his first
query and replied that he was looking for a job. The
answer to this was not assuring.</p>

<p>“Kids are no good in the forest,” said the foreman.
“And the best men have to hustle to hold
their jobs in Camp No. 2. But you look tired, kid.
I’ll feed you and give you a bunk for the night.”</p>

<p>For the moment Charlie was left alone and had a
chance to look about him. Naturally he was interested
in the approach of the crew, who, although
they had just completed a hard day’s work, seemed
to be full of life and good spirits and pushed one
another about, as it seemed to him, rather roughly.
One man who had been near when the foreman
spoke to the lad had heard Scott greet him as
“Kid,” and apparently, as was customary in lumber
camps, a nickname like this was bound to
stick. As the crew came to the Camp House two
shrill blasts given by the cook on his long tin horn
gave a warning to get ready for supper, and this
man spoke up rather roughly:</p>

<p>“Get that turkey off your back, Kid, and roll up
your sleeves for hash.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later one short blast on the horn
announced supper ready, and a stream of rough,
though good-natured, men bolted out of the sleeping-camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and hurried to the door of the cook-camp.
Every member of the crew carried his appetite with
him. They took their seats in an orderly way, for
the cook was always king in the cook-camp, and they
well knew that anyone who acted in a disorderly
way would be ejected, even if the services of the
carving-knife were required. Scott, the foreman,
had told the cook to put on an extra plate, so Kid
was seated, and did justice to the wholesome meal,
which, his first in the camp, was somewhat of a
revelation since it supplied food in plenty, cooked
to a finish and placed steaming hot on the table.
After his long tramp during the day, with only a
snack since breakfast, the meal was very welcome.</p>

<p>Supper over, Kid went back to the sleeping-camp
with the crew, and here the strains of violins, mouth-organs
and concertinas were soon blending with
voices which seemed like the roar of lions. Each
of the crew seemed to have his own tune and sung
whatever was nearest in his heart. Suddenly a voice
rose above the noise and din, calling:</p>

<p>“Sourdough, don’t hog the whole camp. Give
the Kid a chance.”</p>

<p>Charlie was bewildered. Nothing of this nature
had ever been presented to him before. He thought
that he had seen rough-and-tumble play in his games
at school, but the antics of the fun-loving lumbermen
surpassed anything he knew. The black coffee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the pea soup, the pork and beans, and the bread
“like mother makes,” seemed to have added new
fuel to the relentless energy in these forest giants.
In addition to singing, they played jokes on one
another and wrestled and danced. Old boots were
flying through the air and suddenly one of these,
which landed directly on Kid’s nose, caused the blood
to flow freely.</p>

<p>One of the crew, a swarthy giant who, with
matted hair and whiskers, bore a good deal of
resemblance to a grizzly bear and who, by the way,
probably by reason of dissimilitude, had been christened
“Babe,” jumped up in the seat which ran
around the edge of the lower bunks. Clenching his
fist, he followed the direction from which the boot
had been flung, and a warning was given that if
further pranks were tried on the Kid he would smash
the face of the joker so that his best girl would never
recognize him again. All this was quite typical.
There were many rough men in Camp No. 2 ready
to act as protector to a lad like Kid. They liked the
cleanness and manliness of his face, which also
showed a stamping of determination indicating that
he was brave enough to try to take care of himself
when he had to.</p>

<p>After a moment Babe’s eye rested on one of the
crew who was in the habit of meting out rough
treatment to green hands, and who had been familiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
christened “Jumbo.” At times Babe was quite
ready to do his share of the hazing process also, but
he realized that beside him was a lonely lad who had
wandered into the camp without knowing what
experiences he would meet, and under these conditions
he was glad to become the boy’s champion
and ready to fight to the death, if needs be, for him.
Jumbo, in his turn, did not particularly welcome
being called to account before the crew by Babe or
any other member of the camp, and in a moment he
edged his way over to the side of the lad, and in a
provoking tone remarked:</p>

<p>“Did you run away from your home, Kid, or did
your dad kick you out?”</p>

<p>Babe, who had boys of his own, was a good judge
of boy character, and looking down in Charlie’s face
he realized that there was something more in the
situation than lay on the surface. Jumbo’s insulting
remark had cut like a dagger, and the boy’s face bore
a look of pain which at first could not be understood.
Babe noted this, and acting on his instinct for protection,
dropped his fist like a sledge-hammer in
Jumbo’s face and sent him rolling back among the
crew.</p>

<p>In an instant the music and singing ceased. It
was the lull before the storm. Jumbo gathered himself
up and was getting ready to renew the attack
when, like a flash, the door opened and in it stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a splendid specimen of manhood. It was Scott, the
foreman, who instinctively seemed to have the
faculty of arriving in scenes of this kind at the
psychological moment. With one leap he was by
Kid’s side, and seeing the blood on the lad’s face,
he demanded the name of the man who had dealt
the blow. Jumbo was no coward, and furthermore
he had not intended to injure the lad quite so badly.
He faced Scott readily, admitting that he had flung
the boot, but protesting strongly against any intention
of injury. Scott settled the matter characteristically
and definitely by informing the crew that if
any of them had not had enough to quiet their nerves
for the night he was quite ready to accommodate
them outside the camp, adding that men who threw
boots about should be taught a lesson. His challenge
was not accepted.</p>

<p>In a few moments the lights were ordered out,
the crew threw themselves into the bunks and in a
few seconds were dead to the world, and would
remain so until their call would come at four the
next morning.</p>

<p>Something in the lad’s face and in the manliness
with which he accepted the situation strongly
appealed to the foreman, and linking his arm in
Kid’s he led him out of the door and over to his
own sleeping quarters. A little later the boy told the
foreman why he was looking for work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Well, Kid,” came the reply, roughly if kindly,
“this is no charity camp, but I know the heart of
the boss. We’ll give you a fair chance to earn what
you can for the support of your mother and the kids.
I’ll put you to work to-morrow, and you can roll in
with me in my bunk to-night.”</p>

<p>Scott threw off his outer clothing quickly and was
in his bunk in a moment. Kid undressed a little
more slowly, and when the foreman looked up in a
moment he saw why the lad was waiting. He was
kneeling beside his bunk. As he looked at the boy
saying his prayers he was forced to acknowledge
that in some ways the other was braver than he,
since he was not afraid to do his duty as he had been
taught. In that moment Kid had won the foreman’s
heart.</p>

<p>Long before daylight Scott was up to waken the
crew. Kid was sleeping soundly, and since the foreman
knew of the long tramp he had had the day
before he let him sleep till the breakfast call. After
breakfast, in firm but kindly tones, he told Kid he
was going to put him on trial, that if he were of the
right stuff he would make good.</p>

<p>“Put me at any work you think I can do, sir,”
the boy said in return. “Any money I get from your
company I want to earn honestly. I couldn’t accept
charity from you or your boss while I have hands to
work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>In the woods Kid was glad to be put in the hands
of Babe, who was one of the sub-foremen. At first
he was naturally very awkward, but proved himself
to be a willing hand, and although his hands were
soon blistered, every muscle in his body ached, and
he felt at times that his back would surely break, he
applied himself faithfully and without a grumble.
Naturally, as the days went by these conditions were
remedied, and in a short time Babe was satisfied
that the boy was going to make good. When, at the
end of the first month, Scott inquired as to how he
liked the work, his answer was: “Fine, sir. This
is man’s work, and that is what I wanted to do.” At
the time experienced men were receiving twenty-five
dollars per month. It is not to be wondered
at, therefore, that when Scott gave Kid a time-cheque
for twenty dollars for his first month’s work
he was delighted. He was glad to think that he was
now doing a man’s work and receiving a man’s pay.
Of course, the cheque went home to his mother with
a letter full of good cheer.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long until Kid, the youngest member of
the crew, became a favorite in the camp. He was
gifted with a beautiful voice, which was heard when
he was at leisure in the forest solitude and at night
when he sat in the camp and sang songs of home and
mother. At times, too, he was brave enough to sing
songs he had learned in church and Sunday school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and these were sung in such a way that, when they
brought back early memories to the hardened members
of the crew, tears came to the eyes of some
of these swarthy men who, too, thought of their
mothers and of Sunday-school days. By this time,
too, the story of why Kid had been forced to work
in the lumber camp had become well known. For a
time Jumbo, who had been so drastically treated on
the boy’s account on that eventful first night, held
aloof; but when he heard the story and realized how
the lad must have been stung by his thoughtless
remark that night, he walked up to him, offering his
hand and saying heartily:</p>

<p>“Kid, if you’re ever in trouble and want a friend,
call on your Uncle Jumbo.”</p>

<p>In December, the following month, Kid’s time-cheque
mounted to twenty-five dollars, and when he
was being paid Scott informed him that he had
earned every cent of it by working with a willing,
cheerful spirit and by doing his level best, and that
in this way he had been valuable even outside his
regular work as an inspiration to the older members
of the camp. This cheque reached his mother just
before Christmas, in time to purchase a good many
needed things and also to provide for a real Christmas,
with a Christmas-tree and all the other accompaniments,
for the little ones. In his turn Kid was
delighted at Christmas to get a parcel of warm socks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and mittens and a letter full of thanksgiving, in
which the mother expressed her gratefulness to the
men in Camp No. 2 for receiving her boy so kindly,
and making special mention of the firm’s thoughtfulness.</p>

<p class="caption">DRESSING A PINE MONARCH FOR SHIPMENT OVERSEAS.</p>

<p>As spring approached even greater efforts were
put forth in Camp No. 2. Scott, the man who never
tired in doing his best for his employer, was like a
mighty, silent force, appearing everywhere, apparently
looking after everything grimly and resolutely.
He had made up his mind to see all the logs at the
river bank before spring set in, and the fairness of
his treatment made every man resolve that he would
do his part. Every night in camp stories were told
of the number of logs cut and placed upon skids
that day, and of the record loads hauled by one
span of horses to the river. Each night the scaler
handed in a report of the work accomplished that
day to Scott, who, after going over these, lay down
and slept the sleep which comes with the consciousness
of a day’s work well done.</p>

<p>Learning that there was a shortage of teamsters.
Kid, who knew a little about horses, offered himself
for this work, and accordingly was assigned to team
supplies for the camp along the tote road from the
railroad, about sixty miles away. In sending him
out Scott cautioned him of the danger from the
wolves, particularly at night, and told him that if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
were caught out on the road after nightfall he was
to stop and build a fire at the first howl. Failing
time for this he was to unhitch his team, climb on
their backs, and make the camp the best way he
could. He was instructed, however, to provide
against being out after night by leaving the Halfway
house, thirty miles from camp, at daybreak.</p>

<p>Naturally, Kid planned to follow these instructions
carefully, and on his first trip left the Halfway
house even before daylight, but unfortunately,
because of a heavy fall of snow during the day, was
not able to keep to the anticipated schedule. When
about six miles from camp darkness set in and he
found himself alone in the forest.</p>

<p>Suddenly the howl of a wolf was heard. Following
instructions he stopped the team and tried to
gather birchbark and bits of wood to build his fire.
It was cold, forty below, and doubtless the lad was
cold and numb from the cold and frost when the
wolves surrounded him. Probably, also, the team
became frightened at the wolves, had upset the sleigh
and got away. Since there was no witness to the
tragedy no one knew definitely. At the time of the
lad’s probable arrival Scott ran outside the camp
with a lantern and peered down the tote road. As
time went by he became alarmed at the failure of
the lad to arrive and suddenly, when he heard the
dashing of hoofs and saw the team running madly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
as if chased, he understood that something unusual
had happened. With two men and a fresh team he
started back over the tote road, and in a little time
found their fears realized. Coming to the upturned
sleigh, they saw shadowy forms sneaking away into
the forest, and a little further on, underneath a tree
beside the road, which the boy had evidently tried to
climb, were torn boots and some bits of tattered
clothing. Probably the lad had climbed the tree, but
in his numb condition was unable to hang on and
had fallen, becoming a prey to those ferocious
brutes. While the lumber-jacks were in some
respects hard men and had seen accidents and somewhat
similar things before, their regard for the boy
who had proved himself a real man made tears flow
from their eyes, which froze into icicles as they
trickled down their bearded faces. There before
them, written on the snow around their feet, was
the sad tale of how the heroic lad had met his end
in the forest, doing his duty. Scott appreciated what
this side of the tragedy would mean to the lad’s
mother, fully realizing that she would appreciate
how the lad had lived up to his duty, and would
understand that God’s angels had been there to claim
the spirit of her boy and take it up to a better home
than earth affords.</p>

<p>When Scott and his men returned to camp with
the story naturally a gloom was cast over the crew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Next day, when the boss of the camp came in, he
noted on the way the signs of the tragedy, and on
making inquiries was told the sorrowful story.
When told of the good qualities of the lad he was
deeply touched, and leaving the camp the following
day, he resolved to go himself to break the news to
the Kid’s mother, carrying with him a collection of
over a hundred dollars which had been made up by
the members of the crew as a remembrance, to which
he himself added a substantial amount. He drove
directly to the lad’s home, and on his arrival introduced
himself and handed over the purse intended
for the mother. Then came a hard task for him.
He talked for some time, but had difficulty in getting
further with his story than the fact that the money
was a gift from the crew of Camp No. 2. Beads of
perspiration gathered on his brow. His face was
strained, and the matter troubled him so much that
he had almost made up his mind to leave without
telling his story when the mother, noting the look
of pain on his face, pleaded to know all about
Charlie. The boss tried to speak, but could not utter
the word which he felt would blast her hopes. Then,
as she knelt before him and pleaded with him to tell
her the truth, saying that she would be brave, and no
further information came, she left the room a moment,
later appearing with hat and shawl, and said,
“Now, please take me to Charlie.” Finally, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
almost in a whisper, the boss said: “No, you cannot
go to Charlie. His soul is in heaven.”</p>

<p>After an agonized cry, the mother bravely got
hold of herself and said: “Charlie’s soul in heaven.
Thank God. I can go to him there. I shall be brave
and bear the cross, for I know that Charlie will be
company there for his father. They were such
chums here on earth.”</p>

<p>While Charlie’s face was absent from the camp,
his influence was still present. Scott, for instance,
knelt and said his prayers every night before he
climbed into his bunk, just as Kid had done that
first night in camp, and as he prayed for himself
Scott tried to remember the mother and kiddies who
had suffered from the loss of their son and brother.
Many of the men in the camp, too, had been influenced
in a similar way, and Camp No. 2 was a different
place than it had been six months previously.</p>

<p>When the winter’s work was completed and the
men and teams were leaving their quarters, many
a man turned to cast a last look at the camp where
various joys had been known, where gloom had been
shared by all and where trial and difficulty had been
overcome. The procession of men, who through
their experiences together that winter had become a
sort of family, a brotherhood, wended their way
along the tote road. Looking at them none could
deny that these lumber-jacks were a noble breed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
men. The sons and grandsons of pioneers, men of
the north, conquerors of the forest, bound together
by a chain of chivalrous deeds, of hardships and difficulties,
they were doing their part in the building
up of the future of a nation.</p>

<p>Scott was in the sleigh with the leading team.
When they came opposite the spot where Kid had
fought his last battle against the cruel forest conditions,
a halt was ordered. The crew gathered
around the spot and Jumbo, surprisingly, spoke first,
saying: “So here’s where the Kid fought his last
fight. I hope he saw that I wanted to be his friend.
I’d have liked to take a whack at these brutes myself,
or to have taken his place. I guess he would have
been worth more in the world than I’ll be.”</p>

<p>The procession passed on its way sorrowfully.
Possibly never again would the spot be visited by
one who knew the story, but in the years following
the men who had been in Camp No. 2 that winter
told at their firesides tales of a lad who had fought
his battle and won, of the cheerful-faced boy who
was man enough to face the world and the hard
things in it to support his mother, of the young man
who tackled a man’s work and did it without a murmur,
and who, above all these other things, loved
God and was not afraid to acknowledge Him in his
home and in the difficult conditions of the lumber
camp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN APPEAL TO PLAY THE
GAME FAIRLY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> a word here from the experience of an
older man than most of those who will read this
book will be helpful.</p>

<p>In going through the current magazines and trade
journals ordinarily read by young men and women,
I am impressed by the fact that they seem to be
largely devoted to pastime or for showing methods
of accumulating wealth, and in most of these the
latter seems to be termed success. After having seen
a good deal of life in its various aspects I know full
well that there is no success worth mentioning in the
terms of dollars. While it is necessary that we work
hard, and keep everlastingly at it; while it is essential
that we be thrifty and look after what we earn
carefully to produce the right kind of character, it
is a fact to which those who have grown out of
youth will testify if they are serious, that the dollars
a man has do not leave any lasting record for him.</p>

<p>Character is all that lives. The kind words we
speak, the helpful things we do, the service we give
to others willingly, the sacrifices we make cheerfully
and gladly for the good of mankind, are the things
which really count, and these things it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
surely proved are the things which go to make up
real character.</p>

<p>Suppose that you who are reading this are old
enough to be face to face with the realities of life.
Heretofore you have been living at the home fireside,
able to depend on your father and mother for
help in your difficulties of whatever kind. It is as
though your personal craft has been sailing on a
calm mill-pond. Now you have come out of the
mouth of the River of Youth and find yourself face
to face with the great Ocean of Life. New
responsibility will come to you. Difficulties that
you did not appreciate will crop up frequently
and you will not be able to turn to father and
mother for help. If you are made of the right
stuff you will not want to do so, but will want to sail
your own course, and it is in doing so, and in getting
through the storms on your own resources that will
build up your character. It will be necessary to use
courage, grit and determination in the battle of life.
These are the things which will carry you through.
But you will find that life and good fellowship when
properly used will radiate themselves widely and
make their influence largely felt. Let your words
always be truthful. This is a bigger factor in success
than most young people imagine, and if thankfulness
for kindnesses received is apparent this will
smooth the way a good deal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="151a"><img src="images/i_151f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“MEN OF TO-MORROW” AMID NATURE’S<br />
WONDROUS STATUARY.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>With everything else you must remember to play
the game of life fairly. While it is only right to
stand up for one’s own rights and to hold to this
principle firmly it is not at all necessary to try to shift
responsibility to the other fellow. There is far too
much of this in the world. The man who carries
himself honestly, straightforwardly, and is willing
to accept the responsibility for the mistakes he is
occasionally certain to make is much more likely to
be awarded praise for the good things he does than
the chap who is continually trying to get out of
difficulty by shoving the matter to someone else’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the fact that the real things of life
are the ones to be worked for, and by attempting to
work up to an ideal much better progress will be
made. If God gives you powers to construct, to
create, to organize and to develop, be mightily thankful
and do your utmost to develop these powers.
Any man can be mightily useful in the world if he
will seriously take hold of the talents—be they one
or twenty—God gives him and uses them as best he
knows how.</p>

<p>And remember that it is largely the little things
which make up the big ones. What you do every
day, what you read, your thoughts, your words, your
deeds, go to make up yourself, and as you speak and
think and read and do now so will you be hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>If you are to win in the battle of life there must
be no compromise with your better self. One is
either useful to the world or is detrimental. There
is no neutral point. You will be either somebody or
nobody, and remember that so long as you are perfectly
sincere and live according to your own
knowledge and as your conscience tells you, you will
be somebody, and it doesn’t make very much difference
what the world thinks of you. The men who
have proved themselves strongest, the men of genius,
the inventors, the philosophers, the preachers, the
scientists, have in hundreds of cases been men whom
the people of their day laughed at. They did the best
they could according to their light, cared little for
what the people around them thought, and while
they were probably laughed at in their day, time
showed their value to the world and to their fellow
men. Thus it may be with you.</p>

Canada cannot be a strong nation unless her youth become<br /> strong in character.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an opening for your
life’s career, you cannot do better than pick a spot
right here in Canada. Probably the place to start
is right where you are. A lot of people make mistakes
in running around looking for opportunities
when, in all probability, the opportunity is standing
around the corner waiting for the door to be opened
to make a bolt in. It is the wise young man or
woman who can see an opportunity and grab it from
where he stands, and in a good many cases these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
opportunities consist simply in doing honestly, sincerely
and with all the heart that can be put into it
the things which lie right at hand. It may be pitching
hay on the farm, chucking coal into the fire-box
of a locomotive or delivering parcels from a grocery
store. If these things are done with the right spirit
and done as well as one knows how to do them,
bigger opportunities are as certain to crop up all in
good time as the sun is to rise to-morrow morning.
Those of us who look back from added years see
that the hard and trying work in what seemed to be
limited opportunities was really a preparation for
the bigger things to follow, and if the one who is
doing what seems to be the little things doesn’t do
them in the best way he knows how he will not
be ready to take hold of the bigger things when they
come along.</p>

<p>This country of ours, Canada, is to-day, in
resources, an undeveloped opportunity, the greatest
under God’s heaven. With its wealth of land, forest
and mine, with its unknown and undreamed-of
resources in the sections man has not yet trod, it
presents a wealth of opportunity such as our fathers
never dreamed of. The young man or woman who
